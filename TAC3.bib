abstract = {In a now classic paper published in 1991, Alberch introduced the concept of genotype-phenotype (G--{\textgreater}P) mapping to provide a framework for a more sophisticated discussion of the integration between genetics and developmental biology that was then available. The advent of evo-devo first and of the genomic era later would seem to have superseded talk of transitions in phenotypic space and the like, central to Alberch's approach. On the contrary, this paper shows that recent empirical and theoretical advances have only sharpened the need for a different conceptual treatment of how phenotypes are produced. Old-fashioned metaphors like genetic blueprint and genetic programme are not only woefully inadequate but positively misleading about the nature of G--{\textgreater}P, and are being replaced by an algorithmic approach emerging from the study of a variety of actual G--{\textgreater}P maps. These include RNA folding, protein function and the study of evolvable software. Some generalities are emerging from these disparate fields of analysis, and I suggest that the concept of 'developmental encoding' (as opposed to the classical one of genetic encoding) provides a promising computational-theoretical underpinning to coherently integrate ideas on evolvability, modularity and robustness and foster a fruitful framing of the G--{\textgreater}P mapping problem.},

@article{Fan2013a,
abstract = {Functional linear models are developed in this paper for testing associations between quantitative traits and genetic variants, which can be rare variants or common variants or the combination of the two. By treating multiple genetic variants of an individual in a human population as a realization of a stochastic process, the genome of an individual in a chromosome region is a continuum of sequence data rather than discrete observations. The genome of an individual is viewed as a stochastic function that contains both linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information of the genetic markers. By using techniques of functional data analysis, both fixed and mixed effect functional linear models are built to test the association between quantitative traits and genetic variants adjusting for covariates. After extensive simulation analysis, it is shown that the F-distributed tests of the proposed fixed effect functional linear models have higher power than that of sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and its optimal unified test (SKAT-O) for three scenarios in most cases: (1) the causal variants are all rare, (2) the causal variants are both rare and common, and (3) the causal variants are common. The superior performance of the fixed effect functional linear models is most likely due to its optimal utilization of both genetic linkage and LD information of multiple genetic variants in a genome and similarity among different individuals, while SKAT and SKAT-O only model the similarities and pairwise LD but do not model linkage and higher order LD information sufficiently. In addition, the proposed fixed effect models generate accurate type I error rates in simulation studies. We also show that the functional kernel score tests of the proposed mixed effect functional linear models are preferable in candidate gene analysis and small sample problems. The methods are applied to analyze three biochemical traits in data from the Trinity Students Study.},

abstract = {Understanding how metabolic reactions, cell signaling, and developmental pathways translate the genome of an organism into its phenotype is a grand challenge in biology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistically connect genotypes to phenotypes, without any recourse to known molecular interactions, whereas a molecular biology approach directly ties gene function to phenotype through gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Using natural variation in allele-specific expression, GWAS and GRN approaches can be merged into a single framework via structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach leverages the myriad of polymorphisms in natural populations to elucidate and quantitate the molecular pathways that underlie phenotypic variation. The SEM framework can be used to quantitate a GRN, evaluate its consistency across environments or sexes, identify the differences in GRNs between species, and annotate GRNs de novo in non-model organisms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We aimed to test the diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in distinguishing pathological left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) from lesser degrees of trabecular layering seen in healthy volunteers and, in those with cardiomyopathies and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, potential differential diagnoses. We hypothesized that pathological trabeculation could be distinguished by determining the ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium (NC/C ratio). BACKGROUND Left ventricular non-compaction is characterized by a non-compacted myocardial layer in the left ventricle. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images this layer with unprecedented quality, particularly in the ventricular apex, where echocardiography has inherent difficulties. METHODS We analyzed magnetic resonance cine images, using the 17-segment model in 45 healthy volunteers, 25 athletes, 39 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 14 with dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 with hypertensive heart disease, and 30 with aortic stenosis, as well as images from 7 patients previously diagnosed with LVNC whose diagnoses were supported by additional features. RESULTS Areas of non-compaction were common and occurred more frequently in all groups studied in apical and lateral, rather than in basal or septal, segments. A NC/C ratio of {\textgreater}2.3 in diastole distinguished pathological non-compaction, with values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictions of 86{\%}, 99{\%}, 75{\%}, and 99{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Left ventricular non-compaction is diagnosed accurately with CMR using the NC/C ratio in diastole.},

On CMR, patients who presented with dyspnoea had greater left ventricular volumes (both p {\textless} 0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p {\textless} 0.0001) than age-matched, healthy controls. In patients without dyspnoea (n = 21), NC area correlated positively with end-diastolic volume (r = 0.52, p = 0.0184) and end-systolic volume (r = 0.56, p = 0.0095), and negatively with EF (r = -0.72, p = 0.0001). Left ventricular non-compaction is associated with dysrrhythmias, thromboembolic events, chest pain and LV dysfunction. The inverse correlation between NC area and EF suggests that NC contributes to left ventricular dysfunction.},

abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism,

In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility.

abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium (LD) plays a central role in current and proposed methods for mapping complex disease genes. LD-based methods work best when there is a single susceptibility allele at any given disease locus, and generally perform very poorly if there is substantial allelic heterogeneity. The extent of allelic heterogeneity at typical complex disease loci is not yet known, but predictions about allelic heterogeneity have important implications for the design of future mapping studies, including the proposed genome-wide association studies. In this article, we review the available data and models relating to the number and frequencies of susceptibility alleles at complex disease loci-the 'allelic architecture' of human disease genes. We also show that the predicted frequency spectrum of disease variants at a gene depends crucially on the method of ascertainment, for example from prior linkage scans or from surveys of functional candidate loci.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

@article{Speed2012a,
abstract = {Estimation of narrow-sense heritability, h(2), from genome-wide SNPs genotyped in unrelated individuals has recently attracted interest and offers several advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods. With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the {\~{}}300,000 SNPs on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5{\%}-10{\%} can be explained by SNPs reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in SNP-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high LD in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for computing LD-adjusted kinships.},

abstract = {In order to become functionally competent but harmless mediators of the immune system, T cells undergo a strict educational program in the thymus, where they learn to discriminate between self and non-self. This educational program is, to a large extent, mediated by medullary thymic epithelial cells that have a unique capacity to express, and subsequently present, a large fraction of body antigens. While the scope of promiscuously expressed genes by medullary thymic epithelial cells is well-established, relatively little is known about the expression of variants that are generated by co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Our study reveals that in comparison to other cell types, medullary thymic epithelial cells display significantly higher levels of alternative splicing, as well as A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing, which thereby further expand the diversity of their self-antigen repertoire. Interestingly, Aire, the key mediator of promiscuous gene expression in these cells, plays a limited role in the regulation of these transcriptional processes. Our results highlight RNA processing as another layer by which the immune system assures a comprehensive self-representation in the thymus which is required for the establishment of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Promiscuous gene expression (PGE) by thymic epithelial cells (TEC) is essential for generating a diverse T cell antigen receptor repertoire tolerant to self-antigens, and thus for avoiding autoimmunity. Nevertheless, the extent and nature of this unusual expression program within TEC populations and single cells are unknown. Using deep transcriptome sequencing of carefully identified mouse TEC subpopulations, we discovered a program of PGE that is common between medullary (m) and cortical TEC, further elaborated in mTEC, and completed in mature mTEC expressing the autoimmune regulator gene (Aire). TEC populations are capable of expressing up to 19,293 protein-coding genes, the highest number of genes known to be expressed in any cell type. Remarkably, in mouse mTEC, Aire expression alone positively regulates 3980 tissue-restricted genes. Notably, the tissue specificities of these genes include known targets of autoimmunity in human AIRE deficiency. Led by the observation that genes induced by Aire expression are generally characterized by a repressive chromatin state in somatic tissues, we found these genes to be strongly associated with H3K27me3 marks in mTEC. Our findings are consistent with AIRE targeting and inducing the promiscuous expression of genes previously epigenetically silenced by Polycomb group proteins. Comparison of the transcriptomes of 174 single mTEC indicates that genes induced by Aire expression are transcribed stochastically at low cell frequency. Furthermore, when present, Aire expression-dependent transcript levels were 16-fold higher, on average, in individual TEC than in the mTEC population.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Genetic networks are often described statistically using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring the network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse problem. METHODS We introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are now frequently used to describe gene association networks and to detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach is based on (1) improved (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology. RESULTS Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity (power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.},

Clearly, the widely used standard covariance and correlation estimators are ill-suited for this purpose. As statistically efficient and computationally fast alternative we propose a novel shrinkage covariance estimator that exploits the Ledoit-Wolf (2003) lemma for analytic calculation of the optimal shrinkage intensity. Subsequently, we apply this improved covariance estimator (which has guaranteed minimum mean squared error, is well-conditioned, and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks. We show that it performs very favorably compared to competing approaches both in simulations as well as in application to real expression data.},

abstract = {A major task in understanding biological processes is to elucidate the relationships between genes involved in the underlying biological pathways. Microarray data from an increasing number of biologically interrelated experiments now allows for more complete portrayals of functional gene relationships in the pathways. In current studies of gene relationships, the presence of expression dependencies attributable to the biologically interrelated experiments, however, has been widely ignored. When unaccounted for, these (experiment) dependencies can result in inaccurate inferences of functional gene relationships, and hence incorrect biological conclusions. This article contributes a framework consisting of a model and an estimation procedure to infer gene relationships when there are two-way dependencies in the gene expression matrix (the gene-wise and experiment-wise dependencies). The main aspect of the framework is the use of a Kronecker product covariance matrix to model the gene-experiment interactions...},

abstract = {Motivated by the analysis of high-dimensional neuroimaging signals located over the cortical surface, we introduce a novel Principal Component Analysis technique that can handle functional data located over a two-dimensional manifold. For this purpose a regularization approach is adopted, introducing a smoothing penalty coherent with the geodesic distance over the manifold. The model introduced can be applied to any manifold topology, can naturally handle missing data and functional samples evaluated in different grids of points. We approach the discretization task by means of finite element analysis and propose an efficient iterative algorithm for its resolution. We compare the performances of the proposed algorithm with other approaches classically adopted in literature. We finally apply the proposed method to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project, where the method shows substantial differential variations between brain regions that were not apparent with other approaches.},

@article{Mitteroecker2009,
abstract = {Many classic quantitative genetic theories assume the covariance structure among adult phenotypic traits to be relatively static during evolution. But the cross-sectional covariance matrix arises from the joint variation of a large range of developmental processes and hence is not constant over the period during which a population of developing organisms is actually exposed to selection. To examine how development shapes the phenotypic covariance structure, we ordinate the age-specific covariance matrices of shape coordinates for craniofacial growth in rats and humans. The metric that we use for this purpose is given by the square root of the summed squared log relative eigenvalues. This is the natural metric on the space of positive-definite symmetric matrices, which we introduce and justify in a biometric context. In both species, the covariance matrices appear to change continually throughout the full period of postnatal development. The resulting ontogenetic trajectories alter their direction at major changes of the developmental programs whereas they are fairly straight in between. Consequently, phenotypic covariance matrices--and thus also response to selection--should be expected to vary both over ontogenetic and phylogenetic time scales as different phenotypes are necessarily produced by different developmental pathways.},

abstract = {Comparing the covariation patterns of populations or species is a basic step in the evolutionary analysis of quantitative traits. Here I propose a new, simple method to make this comparison in two population samples that is based on comparing the variance explained in each sample by the eigenvectors of its own covariance matrix with that explained by the covariance matrix eigenvectors of the other sample. The rationale of this procedure is that the matrix eigenvectors of two similar samples would explain similar amounts of variance in the two samples. I use computer simulation and morphological covariance matrices from the two morphs in a marine snail hybrid zone to show how the proposed procedure can be used to measure the contribution of the matrices orientation and shape to the overall differentiation. I show how this procedure can detect even modest differences between matrices calculated with moderately sized samples, and how it can be used as the basis for more detailed analyses of the nature of these differences. The new procedure constitutes a useful resource for the comparison of covariance matrices. It could fill the gap between procedures resulting in a single, overall measure of differentiation, and analytical methods based on multiple model comparison not providing such a measure.},

abstract = {Multiple imputation is a commonly used method for handling incomplete covariates as it can provide valid inference when data are missing at random. This depends on being able to correctly specify the parametric model used to impute missing values, which may be difficult in many realistic settings. Imputation by predictive mean matching (PMM) borrows an observed value from a donor with a similar predictive mean; imputation by local residual draws (LRD) instead borrows the donor's residual. Both methods relax some assumptions of parametric imputation, promising greater robustness when the imputation model is misspecified. We review development of PMM and LRD and outline the various forms available, and aim to clarify some choices about how and when they should be used. We compare performance to fully parametric imputation in simulation studies, first when the imputation model is correctly specified and then when it is misspecified. In using PMM or LRD we strongly caution against using a single donor, the default value in some implementations, and instead advocate sampling from a pool of around 10 donors. We also clarify which matching metric is best. Among the current MI software there are several poor implementations. PMM and LRD may have a role for imputing covariates (i) which are not strongly associated with outcome, and (ii) when the imputation model is thought to be slightly but not grossly misspecified. Researchers should spend efforts on specifying the imputation model correctly, rather than expecting predictive mean matching or local residual draws to do the work.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice , the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {A major consideration in multitrait analysis is which traits should be jointly analyzed. As a common strategy, multitrait analysis is performed either on pairs of traits or on all of traits. To fully exploit the power of multitrait analysis, we propose variable selection to choose a subset of informative traits for multitrait quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The proposed method is very useful for achieving optimal statistical power for QTL identification and for disclosing the most relevant traits. It is also a practical strategy to effectively take advantage of multitrait analysis when the number of traits under consideration is too large, making the usual multivariate analysis of all traits challenging. We study the impact of selection bias and the usage of permutation tests in the context of variable selection and develop a powerful implementation procedure of variable selection for genome scanning. We demonstrate the proposed method and selection procedure in a backcross population, using both simulated and real data. The extension to other experimental mapping populations is straightforward.},

abstract = {In this study, a single-trait genomic model (STGM) is compared with a multiple-trait genomic model (MTGM) for genomic prediction using conventional estimated breeding values (EBVs) calculated using a conventional single-trait and multiple-trait linear mixed models as the response variables. Three scenarios with and without missing data were simulated; no missing data, 90{\%} missing data in a trait with high heritability, and 90{\%} missing data in a trait with low heritability. The simulated genome had a length of 500 cM with 5000 equally spaced single nucleotide polymorphism markers and 300 randomly distributed quantitative trait loci (QTL). The true breeding values of each trait were determined using 200 of the QTLs, and the remaining 100 QTLs were assumed to affect both the high (trait I with heritability of 0.3) and the low (trait II with heritability of 0.05) heritability traits. The genetic correlation between traits I and II was 0.5, and the residual correlation was zero. The results showed that when there were no missing records, MTGM and STGM gave the same reliability for the genomic predictions for trait I while, for trait II, MTGM performed better that STGM. When there were missing records for one of the two traits, MTGM performed much better than STGM. In general, the difference in reliability of genomic EBVs predicted using the EBV response variables estimated from either the multiple-trait or single-trait models was relatively small for the trait without missing data. However, for the trait with missing data, the EBV response variable obtained from the multiple-trait model gave a more reliable genomic prediction than the EBV response variable from the single-trait model. These results indicate that MTGM performed better than STGM for the trait with low heritability and for the trait with a limited number of records. Even when the EBV response variable was obtained using the multiple-trait model, the genomic prediction using MTGM was more reliable than the prediction using the STGM.},

We present a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 163 metabolic traits measured in human blood from 1,809 participants from the KORA population, with replication in 422 participants of the TwinsUK cohort. For eight out of nine replicated loci (FADS1, ELOVL2, ACADS, ACADM, ACADL, SPTLC3, ETFDH and SLC16A9), the genetic variant is located in or near genes encoding enzymes or solute carriers whose functions match the associating metabolic traits. In our study, the use of metabolite concentration ratios as proxies for enzymatic reaction rates reduced the variance and yielded robust statistical associations with P values ranging from 3 x 10(-24) to 6.5 x 10(-179). These loci explained 5.6{\%}-36.3{\%} of the observed variance in metabolite concentrations. For several loci, associations with clinically relevant parameters have been reported previously.},

abstract = {For many traits, including susceptibility to common diseases in humans, causal loci uncovered by genetic-mapping studies explain only a minority of the heritable contribution to trait variation. Multiple explanations for this 'missing heritability' have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from near zero to approximately 50 per cent. Detected two-locus interactions explain only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications for future studies of complex and quantitative traits.},

Here, I review several methods that have been developed to perform multiple trait analysis.

The application of network theory to genetics is termed systems genetics and has the potential to address long-standing questions in genetics about complex processes such as coordinate regulation, homeostasis, and pleiotropy.},

Subtle abnormalities of the myocardium may be present in mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+LVH-) but are difficult to quantify. Fractal analysis has been used to define trabeculae in left ventricular noncompaction and to identify normal racial variations. We hypothesized that trabeculae measured by fractal analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images are abnormal in G+LVH- patients, providing a preclinical marker of disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 40 G+LVH- patients (33±15 years, 38{\%} men), 67 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (53±15 years, 76{\%} men; 31 with a pathogenic mutation [G+LVH+]), and 69 matched healthy volunteers (44±15 years, 57{\%} men). Trabeculae were quantified by fractal analysis of cine slices to calculate the fractal dimension, a unitless index of endocardial complexity calculated from endocardial contours after segmentation. In G+LVH- patients, apical left ventricular trabeculation was increased compared with controls (maximal apical fractal dimension, 1.249±0.07 versus 1.199±0.05; P=0.001). In G+LVH+ and G-LVH+ cohorts, maximal apical fractal dimension was greater than in controls (P{\textless}0.0001) irrespective of gene status (G+LVH+: 1.370±0.08; G-LVH+: 1.380±0.09). Compared with controls, G+LVH- patients also had a higher frequency of clefts (28{\%} versus 8{\%}; P=0.02), longer anterior mitral valve leaflets (23.5±3.0 versus 19.7±3.1 mm; P{\textless}0.0001), greater septal systolic wall thickness (12.6±3.2 versus 11.2±2.1 mm; P=0.03), higher ejection fraction (71±4{\%} versus 69±4{\%}; P=0.03), and smaller end-systolic volumes (38±9 versus 43±12 mL; P=0.03).

We have available data from a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study on schizophrenia. Our goals are to identify brain regions of interest (ROIs) with discriminating activation patterns between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls, and to relate the ROIs' activations with available genetic information from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the subjects. For this task we develop a hierarchical mixture model that includes several innovative characteristics: it incorporates the selection of ROIs that discriminate the subjects into separate groups; it allows the mixture components to depend on selected covariates; it includes prior models that capture structural dependencies among the ROIs. Applied to the schizophrenia data set, the model leads to the simultaneous selection of a set of discriminatory ROIs and the relevant SNPs, together with the reconstruction of the correlation structure of the selected regions. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt at a rigorous modeling strategy for imaging genetics data that incorporates all such features.},

abstract = {Imaging traits provide a powerful and biologically relevant substrate to examine the influence of genetics on the brain. Interest in genome-wide, brain-wide search for influential genetic variants is growing, but has mainly focused on univariate, SNP-based association tests. Moving to gene-based multivariate statistics, we can test the combined effect of multiple genetic variants in a single test statistic. Multivariate models can reduce the number of statistical tests in gene-wide or genome-wide scans and may discover gene effects undetectable with SNP-based methods. Here we present a gene-based method for associating the joint effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 genes across 31,662 voxels of the whole brain in 731 elderly subjects (mean age: 75.56 ?? 6.82SD years; 430 males) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects. Using the voxel-level volume difference values as the phenotype, we selected the most significantly associated gene (out of 18,044) at each voxel across the brain. No genes identified were significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but several known candidates were re-identified, as were other genes highly relevant to brain function. GAB2, which has been previously associated with late-onset AD, was identified as the top gene in this study, suggesting the validity of the approach. This multivariate, gene-based voxelwise association study offers a novel framework to detect genetic influences on the brain. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Wang2012a,
abstract = {Motivation: Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and brain imaging techniques enable new approaches to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structures and functions. Traditional association studies typically employ independent and pairwise univariate analysis, which treats single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) as isolated units and ignores important underlying interacting relationships between the units. New methods are proposed here to overcome this limitation. Results: Taking into account the interlinked structure within and between SNPs and imaging QTs, we propose a novel Group-Sparse Multi-task Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method to identify quantitative trait loci for multiple disease-relevant QTs and apply it to a study in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Built upon regression analysis, our model uses a new form of regularization, group 2,1 -norm (G 2,1 -norm), to incorporate the biological group structures among SNPs induced from their genetic arrangement. The new G 2,1 -norm considers the regression coefficients of all the SNPs in each group with respect to all the QTs together and enforces sparsity at the group level. In addition, an 2,1 -norm regularization is utilized to couple feature selection across multiple tasks to make use of the shared underlying mechanism among different brain regions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected SNP predictors relevant to the imaging QTs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and brain imaging techniques enable new approaches to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structures and functions. Traditional association studies typically employ independent and pairwise univariate analysis, which treats single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) as isolated units and ignores important underlying interacting relationships between the units. New methods are proposed here to overcome this limitation.

RESULTS: Taking into account the interlinked structure within and between SNPs and imaging QTs, we propose a novel Group-Sparse Multi-task Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method to identify quantitative trait loci for multiple disease-relevant QTs and apply it to a study in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Built upon regression analysis, our model uses a new form of regularization, group ℓ(2,1)-norm (G(2,1)-norm), to incorporate the biological group structures among SNPs induced from their genetic arrangement. The new G(2,1)-norm considers the regression coefficients of all the SNPs in each group with respect to all the QTs together and enforces sparsity at the group level. In addition, an ℓ(2,1)-norm regularization is utilized to couple feature selection across multiple tasks to make use of the shared underlying mechanism among different brain regions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected SNP predictors relevant to the imaging QTs.

abstract = {Imaging traits provide a powerful and biologically relevant substrate to examine the influence of genetics on the brain. Interest in genome-wide, brain-wide search for influential genetic variants is growing, but has mainly focused on univariate, SNP-based association tests. Moving to gene-based multivariate statistics, we can test the combined effect of multiple genetic variants in a single test statistic. Multivariate models can reduce the number of statistical tests in gene-wide or genome-wide scans and may discover gene effects undetectable with SNP-based methods. Here we present a gene-based method for associating the joint effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 genes across 31,662 voxels of the whole brain in 731 elderly subjects (mean age: 75.56±6.82SD years; 430 males) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects. Using the voxel-level volume difference values as the phenotype, we selected the most significantly associated gene (out of 18,044) at each voxel across the brain. No genes identified were significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but several known candidates were re-identified, as were other genes highly relevant to brain function. GAB2, which has been previously associated with late-onset AD, was identified as the top gene in this study, suggesting the validity of the approach. This multivariate, gene-based voxelwise association study offers a novel framework to detect genetic influences on the brain.},

abstract = {The PR interval on the electrocardiogram reflects atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time. The PR interval is heritable, provides important information about arrhythmia risk, and has been suggested to differ among human races. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified common genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a general paucity of GWA studies in individuals of African ancestry. We performed GWA studies in African American individuals from four cohorts (n = 6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. We observed a strong signal (rs3922844) within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) with genome-wide significant association (p{\textless}2.5 x 10⁻⁸) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2{\%} of PR interval variability in African Americans (beta = 5.1 msec per minor allele, 95{\%} CI = 4.1-6.1, p = 3 x 10⁻²³). This SNP was also associated with PR interval (beta = 2.4 msec per minor allele, 95{\%} CI = 1.8-3.0, p = 3 x 10⁻¹⁶) in individuals of European ancestry (n = 14,042), but with a smaller effect size (p for heterogeneity {\textless}0.001) and variability explained (0.5{\%}). Further meta-analysis of the four cohorts identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A (rs6798015), MEIS1 (rs10865355), and TBX5 (rs7312625) that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration (13.3 msec, p = 0.009) in one but not the other three cohorts. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The PR interval on the ECG reflects atrial depolarization and atrioventricular nodal delay which can be partially differentiated by P wave duration and PR segment, respectively. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci for PR interval, but it remains to be determined whether this is driven by P wave duration, PR segment, or both.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We replicated 7 of the 9 known PR interval loci in 16 468 individuals of European ancestry. Four loci were unambiguously associated with PR segment, while the others were shared for P wave duration and PR segment. Next, we performed a genome-wide analysis on P wave duration and PR segment separately and identified 5 novel loci. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in KCND3 (P=8.3×10(-11)) and FADS2 (P=2.7×10(-8)) were associated with P wave duration, whereas single-nucleotide polymorphisms near IL17D (P=2.3×10(-8)), in EFHA1 (P=3.3×10(-10)), and in LRCH1 (P=2.1×10(-8)) were associated with PR segment. Analysis on DNA elements indicated that genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were enriched at genomic regions suggesting active gene transcription in the human right atrium. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that genes were significantly higher expressed in the right atrium and atrioventricular node compared with left ventricle (P=5.6×10(-6)).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic associations of PR interval seem to be mainly driven by genetic determinants of the PR segment. Some of the PR interval associations are strengthened by a directional consistent effect of genetic determinants of P wave duration. Through genome-wide association we also identified genetic variants specifically associated with P wave duration which might be relevant for cardiac biology.},

abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure with a high familial recurrence risk. So far, the genetics of DCM remains largely unresolved. We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci contributing to sporadic DCM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and seventy-nine DCM patients and 1108 controls contributed to the discovery phase. Pools of DNA stratified on disease status, population, age, and gender were constituted and used for testing association of DCM with 517 382 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Three DCM-associated SNPs were confirmed by individual genotyping (P {\textless} 5.0 10(-7)), and two of them, rs10927875 and rs2234962, were replicated in independent samples (1165 DCM patients and 1302 controls), with P-values of 0.002 and 0.009, respectively. rs10927875 maps to a region on chromosome 1p36.13 which encompasses several genes among which HSPB7 has been formerly suggested to be implicated in DCM. The second identified locus involves rs2234962, a non-synonymous SNP (c.T757C, p. C151R) located within the sequence of BAG3 on chromosome 10q26. To assess whether coding mutations of BAG3 might cause monogenic forms of the disease, we sequenced BAG3 exons in 168 independent index cases diagnosed with familial DCM and identified four truncating and two missense mutations. Each mutation was heterozygous, present in all genotyped relatives affected by the disease and absent in a control group of 347 healthy individuals, strongly suggesting that these mutations are causing the disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This GWAS identified two loci involved in sporadic DCM, one of them probably implicates BAG3. Our results show that rare mutations in BAG3 contribute to monogenic forms of the disease, while common variant(s) in the same gene are implicated in sporadic DCM.},

We carried out a two-stage association scan to map young-onset hypertension susceptibility genes. The first-stage analysis, a genome-wide association study, analyzed 175 matched case-control pairs; the second-stage analysis, a confirmatory association study, verified the results at the first stage based on a total of 1,008 patients and 1,008 controls. Single-locus association tests, multilocus association tests and pair-wise gene-gene interaction tests were performed to identify young-onset hypertension susceptibility genes. After considering stringent adjustments of multiple testing, gene annotation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quality, four SNPs from two SNP triplets with strong association signals (-log(10)(p){\textgreater}7) and 13 SNPs from 8 interactive SNP pairs with strong interactive signals (-log(10)(p){\textgreater}8) were carefully re-examined. The confirmatory study verified the association for a SNP quartet 219 kb and 495 kb downstream of LOC344371 (a hypothetical gene) and RASGRP3 on chromosome 2p22.3, respectively. The latter has been implicated in the abnormal vascular responsiveness to endothelin-1 and angiotensin II in diabetic-hypertensive rats. Intrinsic synergy involving IMPG1 on chromosome 6q14.2-q15 was also verified. IMPG1 encodes interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 which has cation binding capacity.

Allelic associations for multiple biochemical traits (serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, butrylycholinesterase (BCHE), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides and uric acid), and body-mass index, were examined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We aimed to identify common genetic variants affecting more than one of these traits using genome-wide association analysis in 2548 adolescents and 9145 adults from 4986 Australian twin families. Multivariate and univariate associations were performed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Multivariate analyses identified eight loci, and univariate association analyses confirmed two loci influencing more than one trait at p {\textless} 5 × 10-8. These are located on chromosome 8 (LPL gene affecting HDL and triglycerides) and chromosome 19 (TOMM40/APOE-C1-C2-C4 gene cluster affecting LDL and CRP). A locus on chromosome 12 (OASL gene) showed effects on GGT, LDL and CRP. The loci on chromosomes 12 and 19 unexpectedly affected LDL cholesterol and CRP in opposite directions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We identified three possible loci that may affect multiple traits and validated 17 previously-reported loci. Our study demonstrated the usefulness of examining multiple phenotypes jointly and highlights an anomalous effect on CRP, which is increasingly recognised as a marker of cardiovascular risk as well as of inflammation.},

abstract = {Background: Electrocardiographic QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies {\~{}}2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote reentrant arrhythmias. Methods and Results: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5,272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record (EMR) algorithms at five sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the CHARGE consortium QRS GWAS meta-analysis. Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 SNPs were in the chromosome 3 SCN5A and SCN10A loci, where the most significant SNPs were rs1805126 in SCN5A with p=1.2×10−8 (eMERGE) and p=2.5×10−20 (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in SCN10A with p=6×10−6 (eMERGE) and p=5×10−27 (CHARGE). The other loci were in NFIA, near CDKN1A, and near C6orf204. We then performed phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) on variants in these five loci in 13,859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. PheWAS identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with SCN10A and SCN5A variants. SCN10A variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5,272 “heart-healthy” study population. Conclusions: We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to EMRs provide a platform not only for GWAS but may also allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The PheWAS approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become an effective therapy to treat obstructive coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, one of the major drawbacks of PCI is the occurrence of restenosis in 5-25{\%} of all initially treated patients. Restenosis is defined as the re-narrowing of the lumen of the blood vessel, resulting in renewed symptoms and the need for repeated intervention. To identify genetic variants that are associated with restenosis, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 295 patients who developed restenosis (cases) and 571 who did not (controls) from the GENetic Determinants of Restenosis (GENDER) study. Analysis of {\~{}}550 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GENDER was followed by a replication phase in three independent case-control populations (533 cases and 3067 controls). A potential susceptibility locus for restenosis at chromosome 12, including rs10861032 (P(combined) = 1.11 × 10(-7)) and rs9804922 (P(combined) = 1.45 × 10(-6)), was identified in the GWAS and replication phase. In addition, both SNPs were also associated with coronary events (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023) in a trial based cohort set of elderly patients with (enhanced risk of) CAD (PROSPER) and all-cause mortality in PROSPER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.007; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.013) and GENDER (rs10861032, P(additive) = 0.005; rs9804922, P(additive) = 0.023). Further analysis suggests that this locus could be involved in regulatory functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Migraine is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both migraine and CVD are highly heritable. However, the genetic liability for CVD among migraineurs is unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study for incident CVD events during 12 years of follow-up among 5,122 migraineurs participating in the population-based Women's Genome Health Study. Migraine was self-reported and CVD events were confirmed after medical records review. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) and considered a genome-wide p-value {\textless}5×10(-8) as significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among the 5,122 women with migraine 164 incident CVD events occurred during follow-up. No SNP was associated with major CVD, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or CVD death at the genome-wide level; however, five SNPs showed association with p{\textless}5×10(-6). Among migraineurs with aura rs7698623 in MEPE (OR = 6.37; 95{\%} CI 3.15-12.90; p = 2.7×10(-7)) and rs4975709 in IRX4 (OR = 5.06; 95{\%} CI 2.66-9.62; p = 7.7×10(-7)) appeared to be associated with ischemic stroke, rs2143678 located close to MDF1 with major CVD (OR = 3.05; 95{\%} CI 1.98-4.69; p = 4.3×10(-7)), and the intergenic rs1406961 with CVD death (OR = 12.33; 95{\%} CI 4.62-32.87; p = 5.2×10(-7)).

Four associations appeared among migraineurs with aura, two of those with ischemic stroke. Although our population is among the largest with migraine and incident CVD information, these results must be treated with caution, given the limited number of CVD events among women with migraine and the low minor allele frequencies for three of the SNPs. Our results await independent replication and should be considered hypothesis generating for future research.},

abstract = {Hypertension is a heritable and major contributor to the global burden of disease. The sum of rare and common genetic variants robustly identified so far explain only 1{\%}-2{\%} of the population variation in BP and hypertension. This suggests the existence of more undiscovered common variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,621 hypertensive cases and 1,699 controls and follow-up validation analyses in 19,845 cases and 16,541 controls using an extreme case-control design. We identified a locus on chromosome 16 in the 5' region of Uromodulin (UMOD; rs13333226, combined P value of 3.6 × 10⁻¹¹). The minor G allele is associated with a lower risk of hypertension (OR [95{\%}CI]: 0.87 [0.84-0.91]), reduced urinary uromodulin excretion, better renal function; and each copy of the G allele is associated with a 7.7{\%} reduction in risk of CVD events after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status (H.R. = 0.923, 95{\%} CI 0.860-0.991; p = 0.027). In a subset of 13,446 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements, we show that rs13333226 is independently associated with hypertension (unadjusted for eGFR: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p = 0.004; after eGFR adjustment: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p = 0.003). In clinical functional studies, we also consistently show the minor G allele is associated with lower urinary uromodulin excretion. The exclusive expression of uromodulin in the thick portion of the ascending limb of Henle suggests a putative role of this variant in hypertension through an effect on sodium homeostasis. The newly discovered UMOD locus for hypertension has the potential to give new insights into the role of uromodulin in BP regulation and to identify novel drugable targets for reducing cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulse pressure (PP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and nighttime BP parameters are heritable traits. However, the genetic association of pulse pressure and its clinical impact remain undetermined. METHOD AND RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of PP using ambulatory BP monitoring in young-onset hypertensive patients and found a significant association between nighttime PP and SNP rs897876 (p = 0.009) at chromosome 2p14, which contains the predicted gene FLJ16124. Young-onset hypertension patients carrying TT genotypes at rs897876 had higher nighttime PP than those with CT and CC genotypes (TT, 41.6 +/- 7.3 mm Hg; CT, 39.1 +/- 6.0 mm Hg; CC, 38.9 +/- 6.3 mm Hg; p{\textless}0.05,). The T risk allele resulted in a cumulative increase in nighttime PP (beta = 1.036 mm Hg, se. = 0.298, p{\textless}0.001 per T allele). An independent community-based cohort containing 3325 Taiwanese individuals (mean age, 50.2 years) was studied to investigate the genetic impact of rs897876 polymorphisms in determining future cardiovascular events. After an average 7.79 +/- 0.28 years of follow-up, the TT genotype of rs897876 was independently associated with an increased risk (in a recessive model) of coronary artery disease (HR, 2.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.20-4.03; p = 0.01) and total cardiovascular events (HR, 1.99; 95{\%} CI, 1.29-3.06; p = 0.002), suggesting that the TT genotype of rs897876C, which is associated with nighttime pulse pressure in young-onset hypertension patients, could be a genetic prognostic factor of cardiovascular events in the general cohort. CONCLUSION: The TT genotype of rs897876C at 2p14 identified in young-onset hypertensive had higher nighttime PP and could be a genetic prognostic factor of cardiovascular events in the general cohort in Taiwan.},

abstract = {Despite considerable progress in preventive and therapeutic strategies, myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. A total of 55 susceptibility genes have been identified mostly in European genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, large-scale GWAS from other population could possibly find additional susceptibility loci. To identify as many MI susceptibility loci as possible, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis in Japanese population. To identify MI susceptibility loci in Japanese, we conducted a GWAS using 1666 cases and 3198 controls using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and HumanHap550v3 Genotyping BeadChip. We performed replication studies using a total of 11,412 cases and 28,397 controls in the Japanese population. Our study identified two novel susceptibility loci for MI: PLCL2 on chromosome 3p24.3 (rs4618210:A{\textgreater}G, P = 2.60 x 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 0.91) and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs3803915:A{\textgreater}C, P = 3.84 x 10(-9), OR = 0.89). Besides, a total of 14 previously reported MI susceptibility loci were replicated in our study. In particular, we validated a strong association on chromosome 12q24 (rs3782886:A{\textgreater}G: P = 1.14 x 10(-14), OR = 1.46). Following pathway analysis using 265 genes related to MI or coronary artery disease, we found that these loci might be involved in the pathogenesis of MI via the promotion of atherosclerosis. In the present large-scale genomic analysis, we identified PLCL2 and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 as new susceptibility loci for MI in the Japanese population. Our findings will add novel findings for MI susceptibility loci.},

abstract = {Background- The PR interval, as measured by the resting, standard 12-lead ECG, reflects the duration of atrial/atrioventricular nodal depolarization. Substantial evidence exists for a genetic contribution to PR, including genome-wide association studies that have identified common genetic variants at 9 loci influencing PR in populations of European and Asian descent. However, few studies have examined loci associated with PR in African Americans. Methods and Results- We present results from the largest genome-wide association study to date of PR in 13 415 adults of African descent from 10 cohorts. We tested for association between PR (ms) and approximately 2.8 million genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Imputation was performed using HapMap 2 YRI and CEU panels. Study-specific results, adjusted for global ancestry and clinical correlates of PR, were meta-analyzed using the inverse variance method. Variation in genome-wide test statistic distributions was noted within studies (lambda range: 0.9-1.1), although not after genomic control correction was applied to the overall meta-analysis (lambda: 1.008). In addition to generalizing previously reported associations with MEIS1, SCN5A, ARHGAP24, CAV1, and TBX5 to African American populations at the genome-wide significance level (P{\textless}5.0x10(-8)), we also identified a novel locus: ITGA9, located in a region previously implicated in SCN5A expression. The 3p21 region harboring SCN5A also contained 2 additional independent secondary signals influencing PR (P{\textless}5.0x10(-8)). Conclusions- This study demonstrates the ability to map novel loci in African Americans as well as the generalizability of loci associated with PR across populations of African, European, and Asian descent},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent genome-wide association studies in which selected community populations are used have identified genomic signals in SCN10A influencing PR duration. The extent to which this can be demonstrated in cohorts derived from electronic medical records is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a genome-wide association study on 2334 European American patients with normal ECGs without evidence of prior heart disease from the Vanderbilt DNA databank, BioVU, which accrues subjects from routine patient care. Subjects were identified by combinations of natural language processing, laboratory queries, and billing code queries of deidentified medical record data. Subjects were 58{\%} female, of mean (± SD) age 54 ± 15 years, and had mean PR intervals of 158 ± 18 ms. Genotyping was performed with the use of the Illumina Human660W-Quad platform. Our results identify 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6800541, rs6795970, rs6798015, rs7430477) linked to SCN10A associated with PR interval (P=5.73 × 10(-7) to 1.78 × 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS This genome-wide association study confirms a gene heretofore not implicated in cardiac pathophysiology as a modulator of PR interval in humans. This study is one of the first replication genome-wide association studies performed with the use of an electronic medical records-derived cohort, supporting their further use for genotype-phenotype analyses.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by chaotic electrical activity of the atria. It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality. Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF. We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35{\%} of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75{\%} of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy. A stronger association was observed in individuals with typical atrial flutter. Both variants are adjacent to PITX2, which is known to have a critical function in left-right asymmetry of the heart.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke (IS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) share several risk factors and each has a substantial heritability. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to evaluate the extent of shared genetic determination of the two diseases. METHODS: Genome-wide association data were obtained from the METASTROKE, Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAM), and Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics consortia. We first analyzed common variants reaching a nominal threshold of significance (P{\textless}0.01) for CAD for their association with IS and vice versa. We then examined specific overlap across phenotypes for variants that reached a high threshold of significance. Finally, we conducted a joint meta-analysis on the combined phenotype of IS or CAD. Corresponding analyses were performed restricted to the 2167 individuals with the ischemic large artery stroke (LAS) subtype. RESULTS: Common variants associated with CAD at P{\textless}0.01 were associated with a significant excess risk for IS and for LAS and vice versa. Among the 42 known genome-wide significant loci for CAD, 3 and 5 loci were significantly associated with IS and LAS, respectively. In the joint meta-analyses, 15 loci passed genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5×10(-8)) for the combined phenotype of IS or CAD and 17 loci passed genome-wide significance for LAS or CAD. Because these loci had prior evidence for genome-wide significance for CAD, we specifically analyzed the respective signals for IS and LAS and found evidence for association at chr12q24/SH2B3 (PIS=1.62×10(-7)) and ABO (PIS=2.6×10(-4)), as well as at HDAC9 (PLAS=2.32×10(-12)), 9p21 (PLAS=3.70×10(-6)), RAI1-PEMT-RASD1 (PLAS=2.69×10(-5)), EDNRA (PLAS=7.29×10(-4)), and CYP17A1-CNNM2-NT5C2 (PLAS=4.9×10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate substantial overlap in the genetic risk of IS and particularly the LAS subtype with CAD.},

abstract = {The evidence for the existence of genetic susceptibility variants for the common form of hypertension ("essential hypertension") remains weak and inconsistent. We sought genetic variants underlying blood pressure (BP) by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among African Americans, a population group in the United States that is disproportionately affected by hypertension and associated complications, including stroke and kidney diseases. Using a dense panel of over 800,000 SNPs in a discovery sample of 1,017 African Americans from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region, we identified multiple SNPs reaching genome-wide significance for systolic BP in or near the genes: PMS1, SLC24A4, YWHA7, IPO7, and CACANA1H. Two of these genes, SLC24A4 (a sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger) and CACNA1H (a voltage-dependent calcium channel), are potential candidate genes for BP regulation and the latter is a drug target for a class of calcium channel blockers. No variant reached genome wide significance for association with diastolic BP (top scoring SNP rs1867226, p = 5.8 x 10(-7)) or with hypertension as a binary trait (top scoring SNP rs9791170, p = 5.1 x 10(-7)). We replicated some of the significant SNPs in a sample of West Africans. Pathway analysis revealed that genes harboring top-scoring variants cluster in pathways and networks of biologic relevance to hypertension and BP regulation. This is the first GWAS for hypertension and BP in an African American population. The findings suggests that, in addition to or in lieu of relying solely on replicated variants of moderate-to-large effect reaching genome-wide significance, pathway and network approaches may be useful in identifying and prioritizing candidate genes/loci for further experiments.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {The QT interval, an electrocardiographic measure reflecting myocardial repolarization, is a heritable trait. QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain approximately 8-10{\%} of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation. Several newly identified loci encode proteins that physically interact with other recognized repolarization proteins. Our integration of common variant association, expression and orthogonal protein-protein interaction screens provides new insights into cardiac electrophysiology and identifies new candidate genes for ventricular arrhythmias, LQTS and SCD.},

abstract = {Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20{\%} of the variation across individuals1. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample1,2 of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single- nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric},

Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) {\textgreater} 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 {\textless} MAF {\textless} 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.},

Two subtypes of heart failure, ischemic heart disease (ISCH) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), have been studied using microarray platforms. However, microarray has limited resolution. Here we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify gene signatures for heart failure from six individuals, including three controls, one ISCH and two DCM patients. Using genes identified from this small RNA-Seq dataset, we were able to accurately classify heart failure status in a much larger set of 313 individuals. The identified genes significantly overlapped with genes identified via genome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic traits and the promoters of those genes were enriched for binding sites for transcriptions factors. Our results indicate that it is possible to use RNA-Seq to classify disease status for complex diseases such as heart failure using an extremely small training dataset.},

Cardiomyopathy caused by the intrinsic factors is called as primary cardiomyopathy of which two major clinical phenotypes are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Genetic approaches have revealed the disease genes for hereditary primary cardiomyopathy and functional studies have demonstrated that characteristic functional alterations induced by the disease-associated mutations are closely related to the clinical types, such that increased and decreased Ca2+ sensitivities of muscle contraction are associated with HCM and DCM, respectively. In addition, recent studies have suggested that mutations in the Z-disc components found in HCM and DCM may result in increased and decreased stiffness of sarcomere, respectively. Moreover, functional analysis of mutations in the other components of cardiac muscle have suggested that the altered response to metabolic stresses is associated with cardiomyopathy, further indicating the heterogeneity in the etiology and pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 16 July 2015; doi:10.1038/jhg.2015.83.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

Here we describe insights from sequencing whole genomes (low read depth, 7×) or exomes (high read depth, 80×) of nearly 10,000 individuals from population-based and disease collections. In extensively phenotyped cohorts we characterize over 24 million novel sequence variants, generate a highly accurate imputation reference panel and identify novel alleles associated with levels of triglycerides (APOB), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLR and RGAG1) from single-marker and rare variant aggregation tests. We describe population structure and functional annotation of rare and low-frequency variants, use the data to estimate the benefits of sequencing for association studies, and summarize lessons from disease-specific collections. Finally, we make available an extensive resource, including individual-level genetic and phenotypic data and web-based tools to facilitate the exploration of association results.},

abstract = {Promiscuous expression of a plethora of tissue-restricted Ags (TRAs) by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) plays an essential role in T cell tolerance. Although the cellular mechanisms by which promiscuous gene expression (pGE) imposes T cell tolerance have been well characterized, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is to date the only validated molecule known to regulate pGE. AIRE is part of higher-order multiprotein complexes, which promote transcription, elongation, and splicing of a wide range of target genes. How AIRE and its partners mediate these various effects at the molecular level is still largely unclear. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we searched for novel AIRE-interacting proteins and identified the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) as a novel partner. HIPK2 partially colocalized with AIRE in nuclear bodies upon cotransfection and in human mTECs in situ. Moreover, HIPK2 phosphorylated AIRE in vitro and suppressed the coactivator activity of AIRE in a kinase-dependent manner. To evaluate the role of Hipk2 in modulating the function of AIRE in vivo, we compared whole-genome gene signatures of purified mTEC subsets from TEC-specific Hipk2 knockout mice with control mice and identified a small set of differentially expressed genes. Unexpectedly, most differentially expressed genes were confined to the CD80(lo) mTEC subset and preferentially included AIRE-independent TRAs. Thus, although it modulates gene expression in mTECs and in addition affects the size of the medullary compartment, TEC-specific HIPK2 deletion only mildly affects AIRE-directed pGE in vivo.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure (vBP) is associated with ischemic stroke. We sought to determine whether such variability has genetic causes and whether genetic variants associated with BP variability are also associated with ischemic stroke. METHODS: A Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for loci influencing BP variability was undertaken in 3802 individuals from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT) study, in which long-term visit-to-visit and within-visit BP measures were available. Because BP variability is strongly associated with ischemic stroke, we genotyped the sentinel single nucleotide polymorphism in an independent ischemic stroke population comprising 8624 cases and 12 722 controls and in 3900 additional (Scandinavian) participants from the ASCOT study to replicate our findings. RESULTS: The ASCOT discovery GWAS identified a cluster of 17 correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NLGN1 gene (3q26.31) associated with BP variability. The strongest association was with rs976683 (P=1.4×10(-8)). Conditional analysis of rs976683 provided no evidence of additional independent associations at the locus. Analysis of rs976683 in patients with ischemic stroke found no association for overall stroke (odds ratio, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.07; P=0.52) or its subtypes: cardioembolic (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.16; P=0.17), large vessel disease (odds ratio, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.07; P=0.60), and small vessel disease (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.17; P=0.19). No evidence for association was found between rs976683 and BP variability in the additional (Scandinavian) ASCOT participants (P=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms at the NLGN1 locus showing significant association with BP variability. Follow-up analyses did not support an association with risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes.},

abstract = {Previous reports have described several associations of PR, QRS, QT and heart rate with genomic variations by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million SNPs from 2994 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the JPDSC database with electrocardiographic parameters. We confirmed associations of PR interval, QRS duration and QT interval in individuals of Japanese ancestry with 11 of the 45 SNPs (6 of 20 for QT, 5 of 19 for PR and 0 of 6 for QRS) observed among individuals of European, African and Asian (Indian and Korean) ancestries. Those results indicate that many of the electrocardiographic associations with genes are shared by different ethnic groups including Japanese. Possible novel associations found in this study were validated by Korean data. As a result, we identified a novel association of SNP rs4952632[G] (maps near SLC8A1, sodium-calcium exchanger) (P = 7.595 × 10(-6)) with PR interval in Japanese individuals, and replication testing among Koreans confirmed the association of the same SNP with prolonged PR interval. Meta-analysis of the Japanese and Korean datasets demonstrated highly significant associations of SNP rs4952632[G] with a 2.325-ms (95{\%} CI, 1.693-2.957 ms) longer PR interval per minor allele copy (P = 5.598 × 10(-13)). Cell-type-specific SLC8A1 knockout mice have demonstrated a regulatory role of sodium-calcium exchanger in automaticity and conduction in sinoatrial node, atrium and atrioventricular node. Our findings support a functional role of sodium-calcium exchanger in human atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction as suggested by genetically modified mouse models.},

abstract = {Genetic risk prediction has several potential applications in medical research and clinical practice and could be used, for example, to stratify a heterogeneous population of patients by their predicted genetic risk. However, for polygenic traits, such as psychiatric disorders, the accuracy of risk prediction is low. Here we use a multivariate linear mixed model and apply multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction for genetic risk prediction. This method exploits correlations between disorders and simultaneously evaluates individual risk for each disorder. We show that the multivariate approach significantly increases the prediction accuracy for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in the discovery as well as in independent validation datasets. By grouping SNPs based on genome annotation and fitting multiple random effects, we show that the prediction accuracy could be further improved. The gain in prediction accuracy of the multivariate approach is equivalent to an increase in sample size of 34{\%} for schizophrenia, 68{\%} for bipolar disorder, and 76{\%} for major depressive disorders using single trait models. Because our approach can be readily applied to any number of GWAS datasets of correlated traits, it is a flexible and powerful tool to maximize prediction accuracy. With current sample size, risk predictors are not useful in a clinical setting but already are a valuable research tool, for example in experimental designs comparing cases with high and low polygenic risk.},

abstract = {Cardiac fibers, as well as their local arrangement in laminar sheets, have a complex spatial variation of their orientation that has an important role in mechanical and electrical cardiac functions. In this paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its variability within the population. In this study, the population is composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth and ranges from -41° on the epicardium to +66° on the endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion across the population (±13°) is lower than for the laminar sheets (±31°) . This study, based on human hearts, extends previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases due to fiber architecture anomalies.},

abstract = {Diseases often cooccur in individuals more often than expected by chance, and may be explained by shared underlying genetic etiology. A common approach to genetic overlap analyses is to use summary genome-wide association study data to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with multiple traits at a selected P-value threshold. However, P-values do not account for differences in power, whereas Bayes' factors (BFs) do, and may be approximated using summary statistics. We use simulation studies to compare the power of frequentist and Bayesian approaches with overlap analyses, and to decide on appropriate thresholds for comparison between the two methods. It is empirically illustrated that BFs have the advantage over P-values of a decreasing type I error rate as study size increases for single-disease associations. Consequently, the overlap analysis of traits from different-sized studies encounters issues in fair P-value threshold selection, whereas BFs are adjusted automatically. Extensive simulations show that Bayesian overlap analyses tend to have higher power than those that assess association strength with P-values, particularly in low-power scenarios. Calibration tables between BFs and P-values are provided for a range of sample sizes, as well as an approximation approach for sample sizes that are not in the calibration table. Although P-values are sometimes thought more intuitive, these tables assist in removing the opaqueness of Bayesian thresholds and may also be used in the selection of a BF threshold to meet a certain type I error rate. An application of our methods is used to identify variants associated with both obesity and osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {Background - Given the recent declines in heart attack and stroke incidence, it is unclear how women and men differ in first lifetime presentations of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We compared the incidence of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases in women and men at different ages. Methods and Results - We studied 1 937 360 people, aged {\textgreater}30 years and free from diagnosed CVD at baseline (51{\%} women), using linked electronic health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, acute coronary syndrome registry, and mortality (Cardiovascular Research Using LInked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Records [CALIBER] research platform). During 6 years median follow-up between 1997 and 2010, 114 859 people experienced an incident cardiovascular diagnosis, the majority (66{\%}) of which were neither myocardial infarction nor ischemic stroke. Associations of male sex with initial diagnoses of CVD, however, varied from strong (age-adjusted hazard ratios, 3.6-5.0) for abdominal aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, and unheralded coronary death (particularly {\textgreater}60 years), through modest (hazard ratio, 1.5-2.0) for stable angina, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrest, to weak (hazard ratio {\textless}1.5) for transient ischemic attack, intracerebral hemorrhage, and unstable angina, and inverse (0.69) for subarachnoid hemorrhage (all P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions - The majority of initial presentations of CVD are neither myocardial infarction nor ischemic stroke, yet most primary prevention studies focus on these presentations. Sex has differing associations with different CVDs, with implications for risk prediction and management strategies},

abstract = {The prevalence of hypertension in African Americans (AAs) is higher than in other US groups; yet, few have performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in AA. Among people of European descent, GWASs have identified genetic variants at 13 loci that are associated with blood pressure. It is unknown if these variants confer susceptibility in people of African ancestry. Here, we examined genome-wide and candidate gene associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using the Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium consisting of 8591 AAs. Genotypes included genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data utilizing the Affymetrix 6.0 array with imputation to 2.5 million HapMap SNPs and candidate gene SNP data utilizing a 50K cardiovascular gene-centric array (ITMAT-Broad-CARe [IBC] array). For Affymetrix data, the strongest signal for DBP was rs10474346 (P= 3.6 × 10(-8)) located near GPR98 and ARRDC3. For SBP, the strongest signal was rs2258119 in C21orf91 (P= 4.7 × 10(-8)). The top IBC association for SBP was rs2012318 (P= 6.4 × 10(-6)) near SLC25A42 and for DBP was rs2523586 (P= 1.3 × 10(-6)) near HLA-B. None of the top variants replicated in additional AA (n = 11 882) or European-American (n = 69 899) cohorts. We replicated previously reported European-American blood pressure SNPs in our AA samples (SH2B3, P= 0.009; TBX3-TBX5, P= 0.03; and CSK-ULK3, P= 0.0004). These genetic loci represent the best evidence of genetic influences on SBP and DBP in AAs to date. More broadly, this work supports that notion that blood pressure among AAs is a trait with genetic underpinnings but also with significant complexity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal measurements with bivariate response have been analyzed by several authors using two separate models for each response. However, for most of the biological or medical experiments, the two responses are highly correlated and hence a separate model for each response might not be a desirable way to analyze such data. A single model considering a bivariate response provides a more powerful inference as the correlation between the responses is modeled appropriately. In this article, we propose a dynamic statistical model to detect the genes controlling human blood pressure (systolic and diastolic).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: By modeling the mean function with orthogonal Legendre polynomials and the covariance matrix with a stationary parametric structure, we incorporate the statistical ideas in functional genome-wide association studies to detect SNPs which have significant control on human blood pressure. The traditional false discovery rate is used for multiple comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We analyze the data from the Framingham Heart Study to detect such SNPs by appropriately considering gender-gene interaction. We detect 8 SNPs for males and 7 for females which are most significant in controlling blood pressure. The genotype-specific mean curves and additive and dominant effects over time are shown for each significant SNP for both genders. Simulation studies are performed to examine the statistical properties of our model. The current model will be extremely useful in detecting genes controlling different traits and diseases for humans or non-human subjects.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52{\%} women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51{\%} women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or = 0.10, call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Associations at p {\textless} 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {\textless} 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays allow the measurement of transcript abundances for thousands of genes in parallel. Most commonly, a particular sample of interest is studied next to a neutral control, examining relative changes (ratios). Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising modern method for the analysis of such experiments. The condition of ICA algorithms can, however, depend on the characteristics of the data examined, making algorithm properties such as robustness specific to the given application domain. To address the lack of studies examining the robustness of ICA applied to microarray measurements, we report on the stability of variational Bayesian ICA in this domain. Microarray data are usually preprocessed and transformed. Hence we first examined alternative transforms and data selections for the smallest modelling reconstruction errors. Log-ratio data are reconstructed better than non-transformed ratio data by our linear model with a Gaussian error term. To compare ICA results we must allow for ICA invariance under rescaling and permutation of the extracted signatures, which hold the loadings of the original variables (gene transcript ratios) on particular latent variables. We introduced a method to optimally match corresponding signatures between sets of results. The stability of signatures was then examined after (1) repetition of the same analysis run with different random number generator seeds, and (2) repetition of the analysis with partial data sets. The effects of both dropping a proportion of the gene transcript ratios and dropping measurements for several samples have been studied. In summary, signatures with a high relative data power were very likely to be retained, resulting in an overall stability of the analyses. Our analysis of 63 yeast wildtype vs. wild-type experiments, moreover, yielded 10 reliably identified signatures, demonstrating that the variance observed is not just noise.},

We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10 -8 to P = 2.3 × 10 -13) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits.

abstract = {Numerous genetic loci have been associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Europeans. We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10 -8 to P = 2.3 × 10 -13) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5{\%} family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 x 10(-8). To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure (vBP) is associated with ischemic stroke. We sought to determine whether such variability has genetic causes and whether genetic variants associated with BP variability are also associated with ischemic stroke.

METHODS: A Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for loci influencing BP variability was undertaken in 3802 individuals from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT) study, in which long-term visit-to-visit and within-visit BP measures were available. Because BP variability is strongly associated with ischemic stroke, we genotyped the sentinel single nucleotide polymorphism in an independent ischemic stroke population comprising 8624 cases and 12 722 controls and in 3900 additional (Scandinavian) participants from the ASCOT study to replicate our findings.

RESULTS: The ASCOT discovery GWAS identified a cluster of 17 correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NLGN1 gene (3q26.31) associated with BP variability. The strongest association was with rs976683 (P=1.4×10(-8)). Conditional analysis of rs976683 provided no evidence of additional independent associations at the locus. Analysis of rs976683 in patients with ischemic stroke found no association for overall stroke (odds ratio, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.07; P=0.52) or its subtypes: cardioembolic (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.16; P=0.17), large vessel disease (odds ratio, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.07; P=0.60), and small vessel disease (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.17; P=0.19). No evidence for association was found between rs976683 and BP variability in the additional (Scandinavian) ASCOT participants (P=0.18).

CONCLUSIONS: We identified a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms at the NLGN1 locus showing significant association with BP variability. Follow-up analyses did not support an association with risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in the HOMED-BP trial were randomly allocated to first-line treatment with a calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).

METHODS: We recruited 265 (93 for CCB, 71 for ACEI and 101 for ARB) patients who completed the genomic study. Home blood pressure was measured for 5 days off-treatment before randomization and for 5 days after 2-4 weeks of randomized drug treatment. Genotyping was performed by 500K DNA microarray chips. The blood pressure responses to the three drugs were analyzed separately as a quantitative trait. For replication of SNPs with p {\textless} 10(-4), we used the multicenter GEANE study, in which patients were randomized to valsartan or amlodipine.

RESULTS: SNPs in PICALM, TANC2, NUMA1 and APCDD1 were found to be associated with CCB responses and those in ABCC9 and YIPF1 were found to be associated with ARB response with replication.

CONCLUSION: Our approach, the first based on high-fidelity phenotyping by home blood pressure measurement, might be a step in moving towards the personalized treatment of hypertension.},

abstract = {The prevalence of hypertension in African Americans (AAs) is higher than in other US groups; yet, few have performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in AA. Among people of European descent, GWASs have identified genetic variants at 13 loci that are associated with blood pressure. It is unknown if these variants confer susceptibility in people of African ancestry. Here, we examined genome-wide and candidate gene associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using the Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium consisting of 8591 AAs. Genotypes included genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data utilizing the Affymetrix 6.0 array with imputation to 2.5 million HapMap SNPs and candidate gene SNP data utilizing a 50K cardiovascular gene-centric array (ITMAT-Broad-CARe [IBC] array). For Affymetrix data, the strongest signal for DBP was rs10474346 (P= 3.6 × 10(-8)) located near GPR98 and ARRDC3. For SBP, the strongest signal was rs2258119 in C21orf91 (P= 4.7 × 10(-8)). The top IBC association for SBP was rs2012318 (P= 6.4 × 10(-6)) near SLC25A42 and for DBP was rs2523586 (P= 1.3 × 10(-6)) near HLA-B. None of the top variants replicated in additional AA (n = 11 882) or European-American (n = 69 899) cohorts. We replicated previously reported European-American blood pressure SNPs in our AA samples (SH2B3, P= 0.009; TBX3-TBX5, P= 0.03; and CSK-ULK3, P= 0.0004). These genetic loci represent the best evidence of genetic influences on SBP and DBP in AAs to date. More broadly, this work supports that notion that blood pressure among AAs is a trait with genetic underpinnings but also with significant complexity.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a heritable, quantitative trait with intraindividual variability and susceptibility to measurement error. Genetic studies of BP generally use single-visit measurements and thus cannot remove variability occurring over months or years. We leveraged the idea that averaging BP measured across time would improve phenotypic accuracy and thereby increase statistical power to detect genetic associations. We studied systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) averaged over multiple years in 46,629 individuals of European ancestry. We identified 39 trait-variant associations across 19 independent loci (p {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)); five associations (in four loci) uniquely identified by our LTA analyses included those of SBP and MAP at 2p23 (rs1275988, near KCNK3), DBP at 2q11.2 (rs7599598, in FER1L5), and PP at 6p21 (rs10948071, near CRIP3) and 7p13 (rs2949837, near IGFBP3). Replication analyses conducted in cohorts with single-visit BP data showed positive replication of associations and a nominal association (p {\textless} 0.05). We estimated a 20{\%} gain in statistical power with long-term average (LTA) as compared to single-visit BP association studies. Using LTA analysis, we identified genetic loci influencing BP. LTA might be one way of increasing the power of genetic associations for continuous traits in extant samples for other phenotypes that are measured serially over time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.

METHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52{\%} women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51{\%} women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or = 0.10, call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN).

RESULTS: Associations at p {\textless} 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {\textless} 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.

CONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

We identified association of a nonsynonymous SNP, rs6795970, in SCN10A (P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) with PR interval, a marker of cardiac atrioventricular conduction. Replication testing among 6,243 Indian Asians and 5,370 Europeans confirmed that rs6795970 (G{\textgreater}A) is associated with prolonged cardiac conduction (longer P-wave duration, PR interval and QRS duration, P = 10(-5) to 10(-20)). SCN10A encodes Na(V)1.8, a sodium channel. We show that SCN10A is expressed in mouse and human heart tissue and that PR interval is shorter in Scn10a(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. We also find that rs6795970 is associated with a higher risk of heart block (P {\textless} 0.05) and a lower risk of ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.01). Our findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of cardiac conduction, heart block and ventricular fibrillation.},

We tested for association between these loci and subjects with selected arrhythmias in Icelandic and Norwegian case-control sample sets. We observed correlations between TBX5 and CAV1 and atrial fibrillation (P = 4.0 x 10(-5) and P = 0.00032, respectively), between TBX5 and advanced atrioventricular block (P = 0.0067), and between SCN10A and pacemaker implantation (P = 0.0029).

abstract = {Previous reports have described several associations of PR, QRS, QT and heart rate with genomic variations by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million SNPs from 2994 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the JPDSC database with electrocardiographic parameters. We confirmed associations of PR interval, QRS duration and QT interval in individuals of Japanese ancestry with 11 of the 45 SNPs (6 of 20 for QT, 5 of 19 for PR and 0 of 6 for QRS) observed among individuals of European, African and Asian (Indian and Korean) ancestries. Those results indicate that many of the electrocardiographic associations with genes are shared by different ethnic groups including Japanese. Possible novel associations found in this study were validated by Korean data. As a result, we identified a novel association of SNP rs4952632[G] (maps near SLC8A1, sodium-calcium exchanger) (P = 7.595 × 10(-6)) with PR interval in Japanese individuals, and replication testing among Koreans confirmed the association of the same SNP with prolonged PR interval. Meta-analysis of the Japanese and Korean datasets demonstrated highly significant associations of SNP rs4952632[G] with a 2.325-ms (95{\%} CI, 1.693-2.957 ms) longer PR interval per minor allele copy (P = 5.598 × 10(-13)). Cell-type-specific SLC8A1 knockout mice have demonstrated a regulatory role of sodium-calcium exchanger in automaticity and conduction in sinoatrial node, atrium and atrioventricular node. Our findings support a functional role of sodium-calcium exchanger in human atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction as suggested by genetically modified mouse models.},

We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10{\%}) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 [times] 10-12) and Parkinson disease (log OR = -0.15, P = 1.6 [times] 10-7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.},

abstract = {Genetic risk prediction has several potential applications in medical research and clinical practice and could be used, for example, to stratify a heterogeneous population of patients by their predicted genetic risk. However, for polygenic traits, such as psychiatric disorders, the accuracy of risk prediction is low. Here we use a multivariate linear mixed model and apply multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction for genetic risk prediction. This method exploits correlations between disorders and simultaneously evaluates individual risk for each disorder. We show that the multivariate approach significantly increases the prediction accuracy for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in the discovery as well as in independent validation datasets. By grouping SNPs based on genome annotation and fitting multiple random effects, we show that the prediction accuracy could be further improved. The gain in prediction accuracy of the multivariate approach is equivalent to an increase in sample size of 34{\%} for schizophrenia, 68{\%} for bipolar disorder, and 76{\%} for major depressive disorders using single trait models. Because our approach can be readily applied to any number of GWAS datasets of correlated traits, it is a flexible and powerful tool to maximize prediction accuracy. With current sample size, risk predictors are not useful in a clinical setting but already are a valuable research tool, for example in experimental designs comparing cases with high and low polygenic risk.},

abstract = {Despite important advances from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), for most complex human traits and diseases, a sizable proportion of genetic variance remains unexplained and prediction accuracy (PA) is usually low. Evidence suggests that PA can be improved using Whole-Genome Regression (WGR) models where phenotypes are regressed on hundreds of thousands of variants simultaneously. The Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (G-BLUP, a ridge-regression type method) is a commonly used WGR method and has shown good predictive performance when applied to plant and animal breeding populations. However, breeding and human populations differ greatly in a number of factors that can affect the predictive performance of G-BLUP. Using theory, simulations, and real data analysis, we study the performance of G-BLUP when applied to data from related and unrelated human subjects. Under perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL, the prediction R-squared (R(2)) of G-BLUP reaches trait-heritability, asymptotically. However, under imperfect LD between markers and QTL, prediction R(2) based on G-BLUP has a much lower upper bound. We show that the minimum decrease in prediction accuracy caused by imperfect LD between markers and QTL is given by (1-b)(2), where b is the regression of marker-derived genomic relationships on those realized at causal loci. For pairs of related individuals, due to within-family disequilibrium, the patterns of realized genomic similarity are similar across the genome; therefore b is close to one inducing small decrease in R(2). However, with distantly related individuals b reaches very low values imposing a very low upper bound on prediction R(2). Our simulations suggest that for the analysis of data from unrelated individuals, the asymptotic upper bound on R(2) may be of the order of 20{\%} of the trait heritability. We show how PA can be enhanced with use of variable selection or differential shrinkage of estimates of marker effects.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

abstract = {Imputing genotypes from reference panels created by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a cost-effective strategy for augmenting the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) content of genome-wide arrays. The UK10K Cohorts project has generated a data set of 3,781 whole genomes sequenced at low depth (average 7x), aiming to exhaustively characterize genetic variation down to 0.1{\%} minor allele frequency in the British population. Here we demonstrate the value of this resource for improving imputation accuracy at rare and low-frequency variants in both a UK and an Italian population. We show that large increases in imputation accuracy can be achieved by re-phasing WGS reference panels after initial genotype calling. We also present a method for combining WGS panels to improve variant coverage and downstream imputation accuracy, which we illustrate by integrating 7,562 WGS haplotypes from the UK10K project with 2,184 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project. Finally, we introduce a novel approximation that maintains speed without sacrificing imputation accuracy for rare variants.},

@article{Lachance2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies give insight into the genetic basis of common diseases. An open question is whether the allele frequency distributions and ancestral vs. derived states of disease-associated alleles differ from the rest of the genome. Characteristics of disease-associated alleles can be used to increase the yield of future studies.

METHODS: The set of all common disease-associated alleles found in genome-wide association studies prior to January 2010 was analyzed and compared with HapMap and theoretical null expectations. In addition, allele frequency distributions of different disease classes were assessed. Ages of HapMap and disease-associated alleles were also estimated.

RESULTS: The allele frequency distribution of HapMap alleles was qualitatively similar to neutral expectations. However, disease-associated alleles were more likely to be low frequency derived alleles relative to null expectations. 43.7{\%} of disease-associated alleles were ancestral alleles. The mean frequency of disease-associated alleles was less than randomly chosen CEU HapMap alleles (0.394 vs. 0.610, after accounting for probability of detection). Similar patterns were observed for the subset of disease-associated alleles that have been verified in multiple studies. SNPs implicated in genome-wide association studies were enriched for young SNPs compared to randomly selected HapMap loci. Odds ratios of disease-associated alleles tended to be less than 1.5 and varied by frequency, confirming previous studies.

CONCLUSIONS: Alleles associated with genetic disease differ from randomly selected HapMap alleles and neutral expectations. The evolutionary history of alleles (frequency and ancestral vs. derived state) influences whether they are implicated in genome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with human complex traits. However, the genes or functional DNA elements through which these variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.},

To systematically characterize this phenomenon, we analyze tissue-specificity of imprinting from allelic expression data in 1582 primary tissue samples from 178 individuals from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We characterize imprinting in 42 genes, including both novel and previously identified genes. Tissue-specificity of imprinting is widespread, and gender-specific effects are revealed in a small number of genes in muscle with stronger imprinting in males. IGF2 shows maternal expression in the brain instead of the canonical paternal expression elsewhere. Imprinting appears to have only a subtle impact on tissue-specific expression levels, with genes lacking a systematic expression difference between tissues with imprinted and biallelic expression. In summary, our systematic characterization of imprinting in adult tissues highlights variation in imprinting between genes, individuals, and tissues.},

The first decomposition was taken as a reference decomposition; the others were used to form a component matrix of 100 by 100 components. Equivalence relations between components in this matrix, defined as maximum spatial correlations to the components of the reference decomposition, were found by the Hungarian sorting method and used to form 100 equivalence classes for each data set. We then tested the reproducibility of the matched components in the equivalence classes using uncertainty measures based on component distributions, time courses, and ROC curves. Infomax ICA rarely failed to derive nearly the same components in different decompositions. Very few components per data set were poorly reproduced, even using vector angle uncertainty measures stricter than correlation and detection theory measures.},

However the stability of ICA decompositions across sessions from a single subject has not been investigated. The goal of this study was to isolate EEG independent components (ICs) across sessions for each subject so as to assess whether ICs are reproducible across sessions. We used 64-channel EEG data recorded from two subjects during a simple mind-wandering experiment. Each subject participated in 11 twenty-minute sessions over a period of five weeks. Extended Infomax ICA decomposition was performed on the continuous data of each session. We used a simple IC clustering technique based on correlation of scalp topographies. Several clusters of homogenous components were identified for each subject. Typical component clusters accounting for eye movement and eye blink artifacts were identified. Both clusters included one component from each recording session. In addition, several clusters corresponding to brain electrical sources, among them clusters exhibiting prominent alpha, beta and Mu band activities, included components from most sessions. These results present evidence that ICA can provide relatively stable solutions across sessions, with important implications for Brain Computer Interface research.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays allow the measurement of transcript abundances for thousands of genes in parallel. Most commonly, a particular sample of interest is studied next to a neutral control, examining relative changes (ratios). Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising modern method for the analysis of such experiments. The condition of ICA algorithms can, however, depend on the characteristics of the data examined, making algorithm properties such as robustness specific to the given application domain. To address the lack of studies examining the robustness of ICA applied to microarray measurements, we report on the stability of variational Bayesian ICA in this domain. Microarray data are usually preprocessed and transformed. Hence we first examined alternative transforms and data selections for the smallest modelling reconstruction errors. Log-ratio data are reconstructed better than non-transformed ratio data by our linear model with a Gaussian error term. To compare ICA results we must allow for ICA invariance under rescaling and permutation of the extracted signatures, which hold the loadings of the original variables (gene transcript ratios) on particular latent variables. We introduced a method to optimally match corresponding signatures between sets of results. The stability of signatures was then examined after (1) repetition of the same analysis run with different random number generator seeds, and (2) repetition of the analysis with partial data sets. The effects of both dropping a proportion of the gene transcript ratios and dropping measurements for several samples have been studied. In summary, signatures with a high relative data power were very likely to be retained, resulting in an overall stability of the analyses. Our analysis of 63 yeast wildtype vs. wild-type experiments, moreover, yielded 10 reliably identified signatures, demonstrating that the variance observed is not just noise.},

@article{Mitteroecker2016,
abstract = {With the advent of modern imaging and measurement technology, complex phenotypes are increasingly represented by large numbers of measurements, which may not bear biological meaning one by one. For such multivariate phenotypes, studying the pairwise associations between all measurements and all alleles is highly ineﬃcient and prevents insight into the genetic pattern underlying the observed phenotypes. We present a new method for identifying patterns of allelic variation (genetic latent variables) that are maximally associated-in terms of eﬀect size-with patterns of phenotypic variation (phenotypic latent variables). This multivariate genotype-phenotype mapping (MGP) separates phenotypic features under strong genetic control from less genetically determined features and thus permits an analysis of the multivariate structure of genotype-phenotype association, including its dimensionality and the clustering of genetic and phenotypic variables within this association. Diﬀerent variants of MGP maximize diﬀerent measures of genotype-phenotype association: genetic eﬀect, genetic variance, or heritability. In an application to a mouse sample, scored for 353 SNPs and 11 phenotypic traits, the ﬁrst dimension of genetic and phenotypic latent variables accounted for more than 70{\%} of genetic variation present in all the 11 measurements; 43{\%} of variation in this phenotypic pattern was explained by the corresponding genetic latent variable. The ﬁrst three dimensions together suﬃced to account for almost 90{\%} of genetic variation in the measurements and for all the interpretable genotype-phenotype association. Each dimension can be tested as a whole against the hypothesis of no association, thereby reducing the number of statistical tests from 7766 to 3-the maximal number of meaningful independent tests. Important alleles can be selected based on their eﬀect size (additive or non-additive eﬀect on the phenotypic latent variable). This low dimensionality of the genotype-phenotype map has important consequences for gene identiﬁcation and may shed light on the evolvability of organisms.},

abstract = {Associating genetic variation with quantitative measures of gene regulation offers a way to bridge the gap between genotype and complex phenotypes. In order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence the binding of a transcription factor in humans, we measured binding of the multifunctional transcription and chromatin factor CTCF in 51 HapMap cell lines. We identified thousands of QTLs in which genotype differences were associated with differences in CTCF binding strength, hundreds of them confirmed by directly observable allele-specific binding bias. The majority of QTLs were either within 1 kb of the CTCF binding motif, or in linkage disequilibrium with a variant within 1 kb of the motif. On the X chromosome we observed three classes of binding sites: a minority class bound only to the active copy of the X chromosome, the majority class bound to both the active and inactive X, and a small set of female-specific CTCF sites associated with two non-coding RNA genes. In sum, our data reveal extensive genetic effects on CTCF binding, both direct and indirect, and identify a diversity of patterns of CTCF binding on the X chromosome.},

RESULTS: We present a statistical method to compare different patterns of ASE across tissues and to classify genetic variants according to their impact on the tissue-wide expression profile. We focus on strong ASE effects that we are expecting to see for protein-truncating variants, but our method can also be adjusted for other types of ASE effects.

However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted p {\textless} 0.05 threshold, and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We also found novel evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.},

abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people of European ancestry, with rising prevalence in other populations. Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses of these two diseases as separate phenotypes have implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy, in their pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases. Here we expand on the knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive validation of significant findings, with a combined total of more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring one allele over the course of human history) and balancing (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations) selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.},

@article{Quinn2014,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic variation in cis-regulatory elements is an important cause of variation in gene expression. Cis-regulatory variation can be detected by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differences in the expression of the two alleles of a gene. This requires that reads from the two alleles are equally likely to map to a reference genome(s), and that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are accurately called, so that reads derived from the different alleles can be identified. Both of these prerequisites can be achieved by sequencing the genomes of the parents of the individual being studied, but this is often prohibitively costly.

RESULTS: In Drosophila, we demonstrate that biases during read mapping can be avoided by mapping reads to two alternative genomes that incorporate SNPs called from the RNA-seq data. The SNPs can be reliably called from the RNA-seq data itself, provided any variants not found in high-quality SNP databases are filtered out. Finally, we suggest a way of measuring allele-specific expression (ASE) by crossing the line of interest to a reference line with a high-quality genome sequence. Combined with our bioinformatic methods, this approach minimizes mapping biases, allows poor-quality data to be identified and removed and aides in the biological interpretation of the data as the parent of origin of each allele is known. In conclusion, our results suggest that accurate estimates of ASE do not require the parental genomes of the individual being studied to be sequenced.

abstract = {Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.  Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30{\%} of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.  Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.  Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38{\%}) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13{\%}) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.  Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.  Key messages Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials Funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases Funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials Funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38{\%} of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13{\%} of reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure},

Cardiomyopathy caused by the intrinsic factors is called as primary cardiomyopathy of which two major clinical phenotypes are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Genetic approaches have revealed the disease genes for hereditary primary cardiomyopathy and functional studies have demonstrated that characteristic functional alterations induced by the disease-associated mutations are closely related to the clinical types, such that increased and decreased Ca(2+) sensitivities of muscle contraction are associated with HCM and DCM, respectively. In addition, recent studies have suggested that mutations in the Z-disc components found in HCM and DCM may result in increased and decreased stiffness of sarcomere, respectively. Moreover, functional analysis of mutations in the other components of cardiac muscle have suggested that the altered response to metabolic stresses is associated with cardiomyopathy, further indicating the heterogeneity in the etiology and pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {While there have been studies exploring regulatory variation in one or more tissues, the complexity of tissue-specificity in multiple primary tissues is not yet well understood. We explore in depth the role of cis-regulatory variation in three human tissues: lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), skin, and fat. The samples (156 LCL, 160 skin, 166 fat) were derived simultaneously from a subset of well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the MuTHER resource. We discover an abundance of cis-eQTLs in each tissue similar to previous estimates (858 or 4.7{\%} of genes). In addition, we apply factor analysis (FA) to remove effects of latent variables, thus more than doubling the number of our discoveries (1,822 eQTL genes). The unique study design (Matched Co-Twin Analysis--MCTA) permits immediate replication of eQTLs using co-twins (93{\%}-98{\%}) and validation of the considerable gain in eQTL discovery after FA correction. We highlight the challenges of comparing eQTLs between tissues. After verifying previous significance threshold-based estimates of tissue-specificity, we show their limitations given their dependency on statistical power. We propose that continuous estimates of the proportion of tissue-shared signals and direct comparison of the magnitude of effect on the fold change in expression are essential properties that jointly provide a biologically realistic view of tissue-specificity. Under this framework we demonstrate that 30{\%} of eQTLs are shared among the three tissues studied, while another 29{\%} appear exclusively tissue-specific. However, even among the shared eQTLs, a substantial proportion (10{\%}-20{\%}) have significant differences in the magnitude of fold change between genotypic classes across tissues. Our results underline the need to account for the complexity of eQTL tissue-specificity in an effort to assess consequences of such variants for complex traits.},

abstract = {For many genome-wide association (GWA) studies individually genotyping one million or more SNPs provides a marginal increase in coverage at a substantial cost. Much of the information gained is redundant due to the correlation structure inherent in the human genome. Pooling-based GWA studies could benefit significantly by utilizing this redundancy to reduce noise, improve the accuracy of the observations and increase genomic coverage. We introduce a measure of correlation between individual genotyping and pooling, under the same framework that r(2) provides a measure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of SNPs. We then report a new non-haplotype multimarker multi-loci method that leverages the correlation structure between SNPs in the human genome to increase the efficacy of pooling-based GWA studies. We first give a theoretical framework and derivation of our multimarker method. Next, we evaluate simulations using this multimarker approach in comparison to single marker analysis. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our method using different pools of HapMap individuals on the Illumina 450S Duo, Illumina 550K and Affymetrix 5.0 platforms for a combined total of 1 333 631 SNPs. Our results show that use of multimarker analysis reduces noise specific to pooling-based studies, allows for efficient integration of multiple microarray platforms and provides more accurate measures of significance than single marker analysis. Additionally, this approach can be extended to allow for imputing the association significance for SNPs not directly observed using neighboring SNPs in LD. This multimarker method can now be used to cost-effectively complete pooling-based GWA studies with multiple platforms across over one million SNPs and to impute neighboring SNPs weighted for the loss of information due to pooling.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in distinguishing pathological left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) from lesser degrees of trabecular layering seen in healthy volunteers and, in those with cardiomyopathies and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, potential differential diagnoses. We hypothesized that pathological trabeculation could be distinguished by determining the ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium (NC/C ratio).

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular non-compaction is characterized by a non-compacted myocardial layer in the left ventricle. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images this layer with unprecedented quality, particularly in the ventricular apex, where echocardiography has inherent difficulties.

METHODS: We analyzed magnetic resonance cine images, using the 17-segment model in 45 healthy volunteers, 25 athletes, 39 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 14 with dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 with hypertensive heart disease, and 30 with aortic stenosis, as well as images from 7 patients previously diagnosed with LVNC whose diagnoses were supported by additional features.

RESULTS: Areas of non-compaction were common and occurred more frequently in all groups studied in apical and lateral, rather than in basal or septal, segments. A NC/C ratio of {\textgreater}2.3 in diastole distinguished pathological non-compaction, with values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictions of 86{\%}, 99{\%}, 75{\%}, and 99{\%}, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular non-compaction is diagnosed accurately with CMR using the NC/C ratio in diastole.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a myocardial disorder characterized by excessive left ventricular (LV) trabeculae. Current methods for quantification of LV trabeculae have limitations. The aim of this study is to describe a novel technique for quantifying LV trabeculation using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and fractal geometry. Observing that trabeculae appear complex and irregular, we hypothesize that measuring the fractal dimension (FD) of the endocardial border provides a quantitative parameter that can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal trabecular patterns.

METHODS: Fractal analysis is a method of quantifying complex geometric patterns in biological structures. The resulting FD is a unitless measure index of how completely the object fills space. FD increases with increased structural complexity. LV FD was measured using a box-counting method on CMR short-axis cine stacks. Three groups were studied: LVNC (defined by Jenni criteria), n=30(age 41±13; men, 16); healthy whites, n=75(age, 46±16; men, 36); healthy blacks, n=30(age, 40±11; men, 15).

RESULTS: In healthy volunteers FD varied in a characteristic pattern from base to apex along the LV. This pattern was altered in LVNC where apical FD were abnormally elevated. In healthy volunteers, blacks had higher FD than whites in the apical third of the LV (maximal apical FD: 1.253±0.005 vs. 1.235±0.004, p{\textless}0.01) (mean±s.e.m.). Comparing LVNC with healthy volunteers, maximal apical FD was higher in LVNC (1.392±0.010, p{\textless}0.00001). The fractal method was more accurate and reproducible (ICC, 0.97 and 0.96 for intra and inter-observer readings) than two other CMR criteria for LVNC (Petersen and Jacquier).

CONCLUSIONS: FD is higher in LVNC patients compared to healthy volunteers and is higher in healthy blacks than in whites. Fractal analysis provides a quantitative measure of trabeculation and has high reproducibility and accuracy for LVNC diagnosis when compared to current CMR criteria.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A typical genome-wide association study searches for associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a univariate phenotype. However, there is a growing interest to investigate associations between genomics data and multivariate phenotypes, for example, in gene expression or metabolomics studies. A common approach is to perform a univariate test between each genotype-phenotype pair, and then to apply a stringent significance cutoff to account for the large number of tests performed. However, this approach has limited ability to uncover dependencies involving multiple variables. Another trend in the current genetics is the investigation of the impact of rare variants on the phenotype, where the standard methods often fail owing to lack of power when the minor allele is present in only a limited number of individuals.

RESULTS: We propose a new statistical approach based on Bayesian reduced rank regression to assess the impact of multiple SNPs on a high-dimensional phenotype. Because of the method's ability to combine information over multiple SNPs and phenotypes, it is particularly suitable for detecting associations involving rare variants. We demonstrate the potential of our method and compare it with alternatives using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort with 4702 individuals, for whom genome-wide SNP data along with lipoprotein profiles comprising 74 traits are available. We discovered two genes (XRCC4 and MTHFD2L) without previously reported associations, which replicated in a combined analysis of two additional cohorts: 2390 individuals from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study and 3659 individuals from the FINRISK study.

abstract = {The goal of Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) is the identification of genetic variants, usually Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), that are associated with disease risk. However, SNPs detected so far with GWAS for most common diseases only explain a small proportion of their total heritability. Gene Set Analysis (GSA) has been proposed as an alternative to single-SNP analysis with the aim of improving the power of genetic association studies. Nevertheless, most GSA methods rely on expensive computational procedures that make unfeasible their implementation in GWAS. We propose a new GSA method, referred as globalEVT, which uses the extreme value theory to derive gene-level p-values. GlobalEVT reduces dramatically the computational requirements compared to other GSA approaches. In addition, this new approach improves the power by allowing different inheritance models for each genetic variant as illustrated in the simulation study performed and allows the existence of correlation between the SNPs. Real data analysis of an Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) study illustrates the importance of using GSA approaches for exploring new susceptibility genes. Specifically, the globalEVT method is able to detect genes related to Cyclophilin A like domain proteins which is known to play an important role in the mechanisms of ADHD development.},

abstract = {Measurements derived from neuroimaging data can serve as markers of disease and/or healthy development, are largely heritable, and have been increasingly utilized as (intermediate) phenotypes in genetic association studies. To date, imaging genetic studies have mostly focused on discovering isolated genetic effects, typically ignoring potential interactions with non-genetic variables such as disease risk factors, environmental exposures, and epigenetic markers. However, identifying significant interaction effects is critical for revealing the true relationship between genetic and phenotypic variables, and shedding light on disease mechanisms. In this paper, we present a general kernel machine based method for detecting effects of the interaction between multidimensional variable sets. This method can model the joint and epistatic effect of a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accommodate multiple factors that potentially moderate genetic influences, and test for nonlinear interactions between sets of variables in a flexible framework. As a demonstration of application, we applied the method to the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to detect the effects of the interactions between candidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes and a collection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, on hippocampal volume measurements derived from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our method identified that two genes, CR1 and EPHA1, demonstrate significant interactions with CVD risk factors on hippocampal volume, suggesting that CR1 and EPHA1 may play a role in influencing AD-related neurodegeneration in the presence of CVD risks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: -Given the recent declines in heart attack and stroke incidence, it is unclear how women and men differ in first lifetime presentations of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We compared the incidence of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases in women and men at different ages.

METHODS AND RESULTS: -We studied 1,937,360 people, aged ≥30 years and free from diagnosed CVD at baseline (51{\%} women), using linked electronic health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, acute coronary syndrome registry and mortality (CALIBER research platform). During 6 years median follow-up between 1997-2010, 114,859 people experienced an incident cardiovascular diagnosis, the majority (66{\%}) of which were neither myocardial infarction (MI) nor ischemic stroke. Associations of male sex with initial diagnoses of CVD, however, varied from strong (age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) 3.6-5.0) for abdominal aortic aneurysm, MI and unheralded coronary death (particularly under 60 years), through modest (HR 1.5-2.0) for stable angina, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure and cardiac arrest, to weak (HR {\textless}1.5) for transient ischemic attack, intracerebral hemorrhage and unstable angina, and inverse (0.69) for sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (all p{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: -The majority of initial presentations of CVD are neither MI nor ischemic stroke, yet most primary prevention studies focus on these presentations. Sex has differing associations with different CVDs, with implications for risk prediction and management strategies. Clinical Trial Registration Information-www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Although recent genome-wide studies have identified candidate regions under selection, it is not yet clear how natural selection has shaped population differentiation. Here, we have analyzed the degree of population differentiation at 2.8 million Phase II HapMap single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We find that negative selection has globally reduced population differentiation at amino acid-altering mutations, particularly in disease-related genes. Conversely, positive selection has ensured the regional adaptation of human populations by increasing population differentiation in gene regions, primarily at nonsynonymous and 5'-UTR variants. Our analyses identify a fraction of loci that have contributed, and probably still contribute, to the morphological and disease-related phenotypic diversity of current human populations.},

Here, I chronicle the recent history of the burgeoning field of human population genomics, critically assess genome-wide scans for positive selection in humans, identify important gaps in knowledge, and discuss both short- and long-term strategies for traversing the path from the low-resolution, incomplete, and error-prone maps of selection today to the ultimate goal of a detailed molecular, mechanistic, phenotypic, and population genetics characterization of adaptive alleles.},

abstract = {Identifying genomic regions that have been targets of natural selection remains one of the most important and challenging areas of research in genetics. To this end, we report an analysis of 26,530 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with allele frequencies that were determined in three populations. Specifically, we calculated a measure of genetic differentiation, FST, for each locus and examined its distribution at the level of the genome, the chromosome, and individual genes. Through a variety of analyses, we have found statistically significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that selection has influenced extant patterns of human genetic variation. Importantly, by contrasting the FST of individual SNPs to the empirical genome-wide distribution of FST, our results are not confounded by tenuous assumptions of population demographic history. Furthermore, we have identified 174 candidate genes with distribution of genetic variation that indicates that they have been targets of selection. Our work provides a first generation natural selection map of the human genome and provides compelling evidence that selection has shaped extant patterns of human genomic variation.[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.]},

abstract = {Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining was used to study the distribution of filamentous actin in the developing heart of embryonic chicks and rats during the morphogenetic period of cardiac septation. In the chick, intense fluorescence indicative of abundant filamentous actin was observed along the myocardium and in the mesenchymal condensations that formed within the aorticopulmonary septum at day 5. Such cellular condensations and concentration of filamentous actin were not seen in the atrioventricular cushions nor in the preseptation outflow tract. Similar results were found in the 14-day rat embryo. In electron micrographs, microfilament bundles with irregular dense bodies were seen in elongated mesenchymal cells between the valve sites of both species. Cell-cell contacts were observed between such elongated cells and myocyte processes protruding from the nearby myocardial sheath. These histochemical and ultrastructural observations suggest that such mesenchymal condensations serve a specialized mechanical tensile role during embryonic septation of cardiac outflow channels.},

abstract = {Patient-specific simulations of heart (dys)function aimed at personalizing cardiac therapy are hampered by the absence of in vivo imaging technology for clinically acquiring myocardial fiber orientations. The objective of this project was to develop a methodology to estimate cardiac fiber orientations from in vivo images of patient heart geometries. An accurate representation of ventricular geometry and fiber orientations was reconstructed, respectively, from high-resolution ex vivo structural magnetic resonance (MR) and diffusion tensor (DT) MR images of a normal human heart, referred to as the atlas. Ventricular geometry of a patient heart was extracted, via semiautomatic segmentation, from an in vivo computed tomography (CT) image. Using image transformation algorithms, the atlas ventricular geometry was deformed to match that of the patient. Finally, the deformation field was applied to the atlas fiber orientations to obtain an estimate of patient fiber orientations. The accuracy of the fiber estimates was assessed using six normal and three failing canine hearts. The mean absolute difference between inclination angles of acquired and estimated fiber orientations was 15.4 °. Computational simulations of ventricular activation maps and pseudo-ECGs in sinus rhythm and ventricular tachycardia indicated that there are no significant differences between estimated and acquired fiber orientations at a clinically observable level.The new insights obtained from the project will pave the way for the development of patient-specific models of the heart that can aid physicians in personalized diagnosis and decisions regarding electrophysiological interventions.},

In 2008, the European Society of Cardiology updated the classification scheme similar to the World Health Organization classification. At present, there is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria, and diagnosis is based on the morphologic features identified by cardiac imaging studies or at autopsy. Due to lack of standardization of the diagnostic criteria and little awareness of this condition among clinicians, the true prevalence of this disease is not clear.

abstract = {Purpose To quantitatively determine the population variation and relationship of left ventricular (LV) trabeculation to LV function, structure, and clinical variables. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant multicenter study was approved by institutional review boards of participating centers. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) data were evaluated to quantify LV trabeculation as a fractal dimension (FD). Entire cohort participants free of cardiac disease, hypertrophy, hypertension, and diabetes were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into three reference groups (BMI {\textless}25 kg/m(2); BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) to {\textless}30 kg/m(2); and BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) to explore maximal apical FD (FDMaxApical). Multivariable linear regression models determined the relationship between FD and other parameters. Results Included were 2547 participants (mean age, 68.7 years ± 9.1 [standard deviation]; 1211 men). FDMaxApical are in arbitrary units. FDMaxApical reference ranges for BMI 30 kg/m(2) or greater (n = 163), 25 kg/m(2) or greater to less than 30 kg/m(2) (n = 206), and less than 25 kg/m(2) (n = 235) were 1.203 ± 0.06 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.194, 1.212), 1.194 ± 0.06 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.186, 1.202), and 1.169 ± 0.05 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.162, 1.176), respectively. In the entire cohort, adjusted for anthropometrics, trabeculation was higher in African American participants (standardized $\beta$ [s$\beta$] = 0.09; P ≤ .001) and Hispanic participants (s$\beta$ = 0.05; P = .013) compared with white participants and was also higher in African American participants compared with Chinese American participants (s$\beta$ = 0.08; P = .01), and this persisted after adjustment for hypertension and LV size. Hypertension (s$\beta$ = 0.07; P {\textless} .001), LV mass (s$\beta$ = 0.22; P {\textless} .001), and wall thickness (s$\beta$ = 0.27; P {\textless} .001) were positively associated with FDMaxApical even after adjustment. In the group with BMIs less than 25 kg/m(2), Chinese American participants had less trabeculation than white participants (s$\beta$ = -0.15; P = .032). Conclusion Fractal analysis of cardiac MR imaging data measures endocardial complexity, which helps to differentiate normal from abnormal trabecular patterns in healthy versus diseased hearts. Trabeculation is influenced by race and/or ethnicity and, more importantly, by cardiac loading conditions and comorbidities. Clinicians who interpret cine MR imaging data should expect slightly less endocardial complexity in Chinese American patients and more in African American patients, Hispanic patients, hypertensive patients, and those with hypertrophy.

abstract = {Jarid2/Jumonji critically regulates developmental processes including cardiovascular development. Jarid2 knock-out mice exhibit cardiac defects including hypertrabeculation with noncompaction of the ventricular wall. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Jarid2-mediated cardiac development remain unknown. To determine the cardiac lineage-specific roles of Jarid2, we generated myocardial, epicardial, cardiac neural crest, or endothelial conditional Jarid2 knock-out mice using Cre-loxP technology. Only mice with an endothelial deletion of Jarid2 recapitulate phenotypic defects observed in whole body mutants including hypertrabeculation and noncompaction of the ventricle. To identify potential targets of Jarid2, combinatorial approaches using microarray and candidate gene analyses were employed on Jarid2 knock-out embryonic hearts. Whole body or endothelial deletion of Jarid2 leads to increased endocardial Notch1 expression in the developing ventricle, resulting in increased Notch1-dependent signaling to the adjacent myocardium. Using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Jarid2 was found to occupy a specific region on the endogenous Notch1 locus. We propose that failure to properly regulate Notch signaling in Jarid2 mutants likely leads to the defects in the developing ventricular chamber. The identification of Jarid2 as a potential regulator of Notch1 signaling has broad implications for many cellular processes including development, stem cell maintenance, and tumor formation.},

Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

abstract = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Mal{\'{e}}cot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed-in some cases more than twofold-when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

abstract = {A moment estimator of, the coancestry coefficient for alleles within a population, was described by Weir {\&} Cockerham in 1984 (100) and is still widely cited. The estimate is used by population geneticists to characterize population structure, by ecologists to estimate migration rates, by animal breeders to describe genetic variation, and by forensic scientists to quantify the strength of matching DNA profiles. This review extends the work of Weir {\&} Cockerham by allowing different levels of coancestry for different populations, and by allowing non-zero coancestries between pairs of populations. All estimates are relative to the average value of theta between pairs of populations. Moment estimates for within- and between-population theta values are likely to have large sampling variances, although these may be reduced by combining information over loci. Variances also decrease with the numbers of alleles at a locus, and with the numbers of populations sampled. This review also extends the work of Weir {\&} Cockerham by employing maximum likelihood methods under the assumption that allele frequencies follow the normal distribution over populations. For the case of equal theta values within populations and zero theta values between populations, the maximum likelihood estimate is the same as that given by Robertson {\&} Hill in 1984 (70). The review concludes by relating functions of theta values to times of population divergence under a pure drift model.},

It has been standard practice to include principal components of the genotypes in a regression model in order to account for population structure. More recently, the linear mixed model (LMM) has emerged as a powerful method for simultaneously accounting for population structure and kinship. The statistical theory underlying the differences in empirical performance between modeling principal components as fixed versus random effects has not been thoroughly examined. We undertake an analysis to formalize the relationship between these widely used methods and elucidate the statistical properties of each. Moreover, we introduce a new statistic, effective degrees of freedom, that serves as a metric of model complexity and a novel low rank linear mixed model (LRLMM) to learn the dimensionality of the correction for population structure and kinship, and we assess its performance through simulations. A comparison of the results of LRLMM and a standard LMM analysis applied to GWAS data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) illustrates how our theoretical results translate into empirical properties of the mixed model. Finally, the analysis demonstrates the ability of the LRLMM to substantially boost the strength of an association for HDL cholesterol in Europeans.},

abstract = {Sequencing studies are increasingly being conducted to identify rare variants associated with complex traits. The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies. We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component test, SKAT can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using SKAT to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that SKAT can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests. We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies.},

We explore analytical strategies that use HapMap data to improve power of association studies conducted with these fixed sets of markers and show that limited inclusion of specific haplotype tests in association analysis can increase the fraction of common variants captured by 25-100{\%}.

abstract = {The gene has been proposed as an attractive unit of analysis for association studies, but a simple yet valid, powerful, and sufficiently fast method of evaluating the statistical significance of all genes in large, genome-wide datasets has been lacking. Here we propose the use of an extended Simes test that integrates functional information and association evidence to combine the p values of the single nucleotide polymorphisms within a gene to obtain an overall p value for the association of the entire gene. Our computer simulations demonstrate that this test is more powerful than the SNP-based test, offers effective control of the type 1 error rate regardless of gene size and linkage-disequilibrium pattern among markers, and does not need permutation or simulation to evaluate empirical significance. Its statistical power in simulated data is at least comparable, and often superior, to that of several alternative gene-based tests. When applied to real genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets on Crohn disease, the test detected more significant genes than SNP-based tests and alternative gene-based tests. The proposed test, implemented in an open-source package, has the potential to identify additional novel disease-susceptibility genes for complex diseases from large GWAS datasets.},

abstract = {Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the M(eff) method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.},

abstract = {Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) use commercial genotyping microarrays that can assay over a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The number of SNPs is further boosted by advanced statistical genotype-imputation algorithms and large SNP databases for reference human populations. The testing of a huge number of SNPs needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of statistical significance in such genome-wide studies, but this is complicated by the non-independence of SNPs because of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Several previous groups have proposed the use of the effective number of independent markers (M(e)) for the adjustment of multiple testing, but current methods of calculation for M(e) are limited in accuracy or computational speed. Here, we report a more robust and fast method to calculate M(e). Applying this efficient method [implemented in a free software tool named Genetic type 1 error calculator (GEC)], we systematically examined the M(e), and the corresponding p-value thresholds required to control the genome-wide type 1 error rate at 0.05, for 13 Illumina or Affymetrix genotyping arrays, as well as for HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project datasets which are widely used in genotype imputation as reference panels. Our results suggested the use of a p-value threshold of {\~{}}10(-7) as the criterion for genome-wide significance for early commercial genotyping arrays, but slightly more stringent p-value thresholds {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for current or merged commercial genotyping arrays, {\~{}}10(-8) for all common SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset and {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for the common SNPs only within genes.},

abstract = {In this study we challenge the generally accepted view that cardiac chambers form from an array of segmental primordia arranged along the anteroposterior axis of the linear and looping heart tube. We traced the spatial pattern of expression of genes encoding atrial natriuretic factor, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, Chisel, Irx5, Irx4, myosin light chain 2v, and beta-myosin heavy chain and related these to morphogenesis. Based on the patterns we propose a two-step model for chamber formation in the embryonic heart. First, a linear heart forms, which is composed of "primary" myocardium that nonetheless shows polarity in phenotype and gene expression along its anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. Second, specialized ventricular chamber myocardium is specified at the ventral surface of the linear heart tube, while distinct left and right atrial myocardium forms more caudally on laterodorsal surfaces. The process of looping aligns these primordial chambers such that they face the outer curvature. Myocardium of the inner curvature, as well as that of inflow tract, atrioventricular canal, and outflow tract, retains the molecular signature originally found in linear heart tube myocardium. Evidence for distinct transcriptional programs which govern compartmentalization in the forming heart is seen in the patterns of expression of Hand1 for the dorsoventral axis, Irx4 and Tbx5 for the anteroposterior axis, and Irx5 for the distinction between primary and chamber myocardium.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular development has become a crucial element of transgene technology in that many transgenic and knockout mice unexpectedly present with a cardiac phenotype, which often turns out to be embryolethal. This demonstrates that formation of the heart and the connecting vessels is essential for the functioning vertebrate organism. The embryonic mesoderm is the source of both the cardiogenic plate, giving rise to the future myocardium as well as the endocardium that will line the system on the inner side. Genetic cascades are unravelled that direct dextral looping and subsequent secondary looping and wedging of the outflow tract of the primitive heart tube. This tube consists of a number of transitional zones and intervening primitive cardiac chambers. After septation and valve formation, the mature two atria and two ventricles still contain elements of the primitive chambers as well as transitional zones. An essential additional element is the contribution of extracardiac cell populations like neural crest cells and epicardium-derived cells. Whereas the neural crest cell is of specific importance for outflow tract septation and formation of the pharyngeal arch arteries, the epicardium-derived cells are essential for proper maturation of the myocardium and coronary vascular formation. Inductive signals, sometimes linked to apoptosis, of the extracardiac cells are thought to be instructive for differentiation of the conduction system. In summary, cardiovascular development is a complex interplay of many cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Study of both (transgenic) animal models and human pathology is unravelling the mechanisms underlying congenital cardiac anomalies.},

abstract = {During folding of the embryo, lateroanterior visceral mesoderm forms the embryonic tubular heart at the midline, just ventral to the foregut. In mice, this nascent tube contains the future left ventricle and atrioventricular canal. Mesenchymal cells subsequently recruited to the cardiac lineage at the intake and the outflow of the tube will form the atria and the right ventricle and outflow tract, respectively. Shortly after its emergence, the embryonic heart tube starts to loop, and the first signs of left ventricular chamber differentiation become visible on the outer curvature of the middle portion of the tube. Subsequently, the right ventricle differentiates cranially, and the atria caudally, while the inflow tract, atrioventricular canal, inner curvatures, and outflow tract form recognizable components flanking the chambers. The latter, nonchamber regions in turn provide signals for the formation of the cushion mesenchyme, are involved in remodeling of the heart, and form the nodes of the conduction system. This review discusses how the patterning of the heart tube relates to the localized differentiation of atrial and ventricular chambers, why some parts of the heart do not form chambers, and how this relates to the formation of the conduction system.},

abstract = {The vertebrate cranium is a prime example of the high evolvability of complex traits. While evidence of genes and developmental pathways underlying craniofacial shape determination is accumulating, we are still far from understanding how such variation at the genetic level is translated into craniofacial shape variation. Here we used 3D geometric morphometrics to map genes involved in shape determination in a population of outbred mice (Carworth Farms White, or CFW). We defined shape traits via principal component analysis of 3D skull and mandible measurements. We mapped genetic loci associated with shape traits at {\~{}}80,000 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in {\~{}}700 male mice. We found that craniofacial shape and size are highly heritable, polygenic traits. Despite the polygenic nature of the traits, we identified 17 loci that explain variation in skull shape, and 8 loci associated with variation in mandible shape. Together, the associated variants account for 11.4{\%} of skull and 4.4{\%} of mandible shape variation, however, the total additive genetic variance associated with phenotypic variation was estimated in {\~{}}45{\%}. Candidate genes within the associated loci have known roles in craniofacial development; this includes 6 transcription factors and several regulators of bone developmental pathways. One gene, Mn1, has an unusually large effect on shape variation in our study. A knockout of this gene was previously shown to affect negatively the development of membranous bones of the cranial skeleton, and evolutionary analysis shows that the gene has arisen at the base of the bony vertebrates (Eutelostomi), where the ossified head first appeared. Therefore, Mn1 emerges as a key gene for both skull formation and within-population shape variation. Our study shows that it is possible to identify important developmental genes through genome-wide mapping of high-dimensional shape features in an outbred population.},

abstract = {Promiscuous expression of a plethora of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is essential for central tolerance. This promiscuous gene expression (pGE) is characterized by inclusion of a broad range of TRAs and by its mosaic expression patterns, i.e. each antigen is only expressed in 1-3{\%} of mTECs. It is currently unclear to which extent random and/or deterministic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of pGE. In order to address this issue, we deconstructed the transcriptional heterogeneity in mTEC to minor subsets expressing a particular TRA. We identified six delineable co-expression groups in mouse mTECs. These co-expression groups displayed a variable degree of mutual overlap and mapped to different stages of mTEC development. Co-expressed genes showed chromosomal preference and clustered within delimited genomic regions. Moreover, co-expression groups in mice and humans selected by a pair of orthologous genes preferentially co-expressed sets of orthologous genes attesting to the species conservation of pGE between mouse and human. Furthermore, co-expressed genes were enriched for specific transcription factor binding motifs concomitant with up-regulation of the corresponding transcription factors, implicating additional factors in the regulation of pGE besides the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire). Thus promiscuous transcription of self-antigens in mTECs entails a highly coordinated process, which is evolutionary strictly conserved between species.},

Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing and obtained evidence of numerous recurring TRA-co-expression patterns, each present in only a subset of mTECs.

abstract = {Relatedness estimators are widely used in genetic studies, but effects of population structure on performance of estimators, criteria to evaluate estimators, and benefits of using such estimators in conservation programs have to date received little attention. In this article we present new estimators, based on the relationship between coancestry and molecular similarity between individuals, and compare them with existing estimators using Monte Carlo simulation of populations, either panmictic or structured. Estimators were evaluated using statistical criteria and a diversity criterion that minimized relatedness. Results show that ranking of estimators depends on the population structure. An existing estimator based on two-gene and four-gene coefficients of identity performs best in panmictic populations, whereas a new estimator based on coancestry performs best in structured populations. The number of marker alleles and loci did not affect ranking of estimators. Statistical criteria were insufficient to evaluate estimators for their use in conservation programs. The regression coefficient of pedigree relatedness on estimated relatedness (beta2) was substantially lower than unity for all estimators, causing overestimation of the diversity conserved. A simple correction to achieve beta2 = 1 improves both existing and new estimators. Using relatedness estimates with correction considerably increased diversity in structured populations, but did not do so or even decreased diversity in panmictic populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In the analysis of complex traits, genetic effects can be confounded with non-genetic effects, especially when using full-sib families. Dominance and epistatic effects are typically confounded with additive genetic and non-genetic effects. This confounding may cause the estimated genetic variance components to be inaccurate and biased.METHODS:In this study, we constructed genetic covariance structures from whole-genome marker data, and thus used realized relationship matrices to estimate variance components in a heterogenous population of {\~{}} 2200 mice for which four complex traits were investigated. These mice were genotyped for more than 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the variances due to family, cage and genetic effects were estimated by models based on pedigree information only, aggregate SNP information, and model selection for specific SNP effects.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:We show that the use of genome-wide SNP information can disentangle confounding factors to estimate genetic variances by separating genetic and non-genetic effects. The estimated variance components using realized relationship were more accurate and less biased, compared to those based on pedigree information only. Models that allow the selection of individual SNP in addition to fitting a relationship matrix are more efficient for traits with a significant dominance variance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
This study used high-resolution 3-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance to define the anatomical and functional left ventricular (LV) properties associated with increasing systolic blood pressure (SBP) in a drug-na{\"{i}}ve cohort. 

BACKGROUND
LV hypertrophy and remodeling occur in response to hemodynamic stress but little is known about how these phenotypic changes are initiated in the general population. 

METHODS
In this study, 1,258 volunteers (54{\%} women, mean age 40.6 ± 12.8 years) without self-reported cardiovascular disease underwent 3-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance combined with computational modeling. The relationship between SBP and wall thickness (WT), relative WT, end-systolic wall stress (WS), and fractional wall thickening were analyzed using 3-dimensional regression models adjusted for body surface area, sex, race, age, and multiple testing. Significantly associated points in the LV model (p {\textless} 0.05) were identified and the relationship with SBP reported as mean $\beta$ coefficients. 

RESULTS
There was a continuous relationship between SBP and asymmetric concentric hypertrophic adaptation of the septum and anterior wall that was associated with normalization of wall stress. In the lateral wall an increase in wall stress with rising SBP was not balanced by a commensurate hypertrophic relationship. In normotensives, SBP was positively associated with WT ($\beta$ = 0.09) and relative WT ($\beta$ = 0.07) in the septal and anterior walls, and this regional hypertrophic relationship was progressively stronger among pre-hypertensives ($\beta$ = 0.10) and hypertensives ($\beta$ = 0.30). 

CONCLUSIONS
These findings show that the precursors of the hypertensive heart phenotype can be traced to healthy normotensive adults and that an independent and continuous relationship exists between adverse LV remodeling and SBP in a low-risk population. These adaptations show distinct regional variations with concentric hypertrophy of the septum and eccentric hypertrophy of the lateral wall, which challenge conventional classifications of LV remodeling.},

abstract = {A major constraint on the evolution of large body sizes in animals is an increased risk of developing cancer. There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as "Peto′s Paradox". Here we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes are transcribed and translated and contribute to an enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis via a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto′s paradox in Proboscideans.},

Based on the atlas, statistical methods were used to study the variation of cardiac shapes and the distribution of cardiac motion across the spatio-temporal domain. We have shown how statistical parametric mapping (SPM) can be combined with a general linear model to study the impact of gender and age on regional myocardial wall thickness. Finally, we have also investigated the influence of the population size on atlas construction and atlas-based analysis.

abstract = {A three-stage approach was undertaken using genome-wide, case-control, and case-only association studies to identify genetic variants associated with heart failure mortality. In an Amish founder population (n = 851), cardiac hypertrophy, a trait integral to the adaptive response to failure, was found to be heritable (h² = 0.28, p = 0.0002) and GWAS revealed 21 candidate hypertrophy SNPs. In a case (n = 1,610)-control (n = 463) study in unrelated Caucasians, one of the SNPs associated with hypertrophy (rs2207418, p = 8 × 10⁻⁶), was associated with heart failure, RR = 1.85(1.25-2.73, p = 0.0019). In heart failure cases rs2207418 was associated with increased mortality, HR = 1.51(1.20-1.97, p = 0.0004). There was consistency between studies, with the GG allele being associated with increased ventricular mass ({\~{}}13 g/m²) in the Amish, heart failure risk, and heart failure mortality. This SNP is in a gene desert of chromosome 20p12. Five genes are within 2.0 mbp of rs2207418 but with low LD between their SNPs and rs2207418. A region near this SNP is highly conserved in multiple vertebrates (lod score = 1,208). This conservation and the internal consistency across studies suggests that this region has biologic importance in heart failure, potentially acting as an enhancer or repressor element. rs2207418 may be useful for predicting a more progressive form of heart failure that may require aggressive therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: T-peak to T-end (TPE) interval on the electrocardiogram is a measure of myocardial dispersion of repolarization and is associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The genetic factors affecting the TPE interval are largely unknown.

OBJECTIVE: To identify common genetic variants that affect the duration of the TPE interval in the general population.

METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study on 1870 individuals of Finnish origin participating in the Health 2000 Study. The TPE interval was measured from T-peak to T-wave end in leads II, V(2), and V(5) on resting electrocardiograms, and the mean of these TPE intervals was adjusted for age, sex, and Cornell voltage-duration product. We sought replication for a genome-wide significant result in the 3745 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study.

RESULTS: We identified a locus on 17q24 that was associated with the TPE interval. The minor allele of the common variant rs7219669 was associated with a 1.8-ms shortening of the TPE interval (P = 1.1 × 10(-10)). The association was replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (-1.5 ms; P = 1.3 × 10(-4)). The overall effect estimate of rs7219669 in the 2 studies was -1.7 ms (P = 5.7 × 10(-14)). The common variant rs7219669 maps downstream of the KCNJ2 gene, in which rare mutations cause congenital long and short QT syndromes.

CONCLUSION: The common variant rs7219669 is associated with the TPE interval and is thus a candidate to modify repolarization-related arrhythmia susceptibility in individuals carrying the major allele of this polymorphism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The early repolarization pattern (ERP) is common and associated with risk of sudden cardiac death. ERP is heritable, and mutations have been described in syndromatic cases.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to identify common genetic variants influencing ERP.

METHODS: We ascertained ERP on the basis of electrocardiograms in 3 large community-based cohorts from Europe and the United States: the Framingham Heart Study, the Health 2000 Study, and the KORA F4 Study. We analyzed genome-wide association studies in participants with and without ERP by logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model and meta-analyzed individual cohort results. We then sought to strengthen support for findings that reached P ≤ 1 × 10(-5) in independent individuals by direct genotyping or in-silico analysis of genome-wide data. We meta-analyzed the results from both stages.

RESULTS: Of 7482 individuals in the discovery stage, 452 showed ERP (ERP positive: mean age 46.9 ± 8.9 years, 30.3{\%} women; ERP negative: 47.5 ± 9.4 years, 54.2{\%} women). After meta-analysis, 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms reached P ≤ 1 × 10(-5): The most significant finding was intergenic rs11653989 (odds ratio 0.47; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.36-0.61; P = 6.9 × 10(-9)). The most biologically relevant finding was intronic to KCND3: rs17029069 (odds ratio 1.46; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.25-1.69; P = 8.5 × 10(-7)). In the replication step (7151 individuals), none of the 8 variants replicated, and combined meta-analysis results failed to reach genome-wide significance.

CONCLUSIONS: In a genome-wide association study, we were not able to reliably identify genetic variants predisposing to ERP, presumably due to insufficient statistical power and phenotype heterogeneity. The reported heritability of ERP warrants continued investigation in larger well-phenotyped populations.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P {\textless} 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern genotyping platforms permit a systematic search for inherited components of complex diseases. We performed a joint analysis of two genomewide association studies of coronary artery disease. METHODS: We first identified chromosomal loci that were strongly associated with coronary artery disease in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study (which involved 1926 case subjects with coronary artery disease and 2938 controls) and looked for replication in the German MI [Myocardial Infarction] Family Study (which involved 875 case subjects with myocardial infarction and 1644 controls). Data on other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with coronary artery disease in either study (P{\textless}0.001) were then combined to identify additional loci with a high probability of true association. Genotyping in both studies was performed with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix). RESULTS: Of thousands of chromosomal loci studied, the same locus had the strongest association with coronary artery disease in both the WTCCC and the German studies: chromosome 9p21.3 (SNP, rs1333049) (P=1.80x10(-14) and P=3.40x10(-6), respectively). Overall, the WTCCC study revealed nine loci that were strongly associated with coronary artery disease (P{\textless}1.2x10(-5) and less than a 50{\%} chance of being falsely positive). In addition to chromosome 9p21.3, two of these loci were successfully replicated (adjusted P{\textless}0.05) in the German study: chromosome 6q25.1 (rs6922269) and chromosome 2q36.3 (rs2943634). The combined analysis of the two studies identified four additional loci significantly associated with coronary artery disease (P{\textless}1.3x10(-6)) and a high probability ({\textgreater}80{\%}) of a true association: chromosomes 1p13.3 (rs599839), 1q41 (rs17465637), 10q11.21 (rs501120), and 15q22.33 (rs17228212). CONCLUSIONS: We identified several genetic loci that, individually and in aggregate, substantially affect the risk of development of coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {Hypertension places a major burden on individual and public health, but the genetic basis of this complex disorder is poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) in Amish subjects and found strong association signals with common variants in a serine/threonine kinase gene, STK39. We confirmed this association in an independent Amish and 4 non-Amish Caucasian samples including the Diabetes Genetics Initiative, Framingham Heart Study, GenNet, and Hutterites (meta-analysis combining all studies: n = 7,125, P {\textless} 10(-6)). The higher BP-associated alleles have frequencies {\textgreater} 0.09 and were associated with increases of 3.3/1.3 mm Hg in SBP/DBP, respectively, in the Amish subjects and with smaller but consistent effects across the non-Amish studies. Cell-based functional studies showed that STK39 interacts with WNK kinases and cation-chloride cotransporters, mutations in which cause monogenic forms of BP dysregulation. We demonstrate that in vivo, STK39 is expressed in the distal nephron, where it may interact with these proteins. Although none of the associated SNPs alter protein structure, we identified and experimentally confirmed a highly conserved intronic element with allele-specific in vitro transcription activity as a functional candidate for this association. Thus, variants in STK39 may influence BP by increasing STK39 expression and consequently altering renal Na(+) excretion, thus unifying rare and common BP-regulating alleles in the same physiological pathway.},

To date, identification of common genetic variants influencing blood pressure has proven challenging. We tested 2.5 million genotyped and imputed SNPs for association with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 34,433 subjects of European ancestry from the Global BPgen consortium and followed up findings with direct genotyping (N ≤ 71,225 European ancestry, N ≤ 12,889 Indian Asian ancestry) and in silico comparison (CHARGE consortium, N = 29,136). We identified association between systolic or diastolic blood pressure and common variants in eight regions near the CYP17A1 (P = 7 × 10(-24)), CYP1A2 (P = 1 × 10(-23)), FGF5 (P = 1 × 10(-21)), SH2B3 (P = 3 × 10(-18)), MTHFR (P = 2 × 10(-13)), c10orf107 (P = 1 × 10(-9)), ZNF652 (P = 5 × 10(-9)) and PLCD3 (P = 1 × 10(-8)) genes. All variants associated with continuous blood pressure were associated with dichotomous hypertension. These associations between common variants and blood pressure and hypertension offer mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and may point to novel targets for interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as concomitant disorders of lipid and glucose metabolism, central obesity, and high blood pressure, with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study tests whether common genetic variants with pleiotropic effects account for some of the correlated architecture among five metabolic phenotypes that define MetS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Seven studies of the STAMPEED consortium, comprising 22,161 participants of European ancestry, underwent genome-wide association analyses of metabolic traits using a panel of ∼2.5 million imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Phenotypes were defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria for MetS in pairwise combinations. Individuals exceeding the NCEP thresholds for both traits of a pair were considered affected. RESULTS Twenty-nine common variants were associated with MetS or a pair of traits. Variants in the genes LPL, CETP, APOA5 (and its cluster), GCKR (and its cluster), LIPC, TRIB1, LOC100128354/MTNR1B, ABCB11, and LOC100129150 were further tested for their association with individual qualitative and quantitative traits. None of the 16 top SNPs (one per gene) associated simultaneously with more than two individual traits. Of them 11 variants showed nominal associations with MetS per se. The effects of 16 top SNPs on the quantitative traits were relatively small, together explaining from ∼9{\%} of the variance in triglycerides, 5.8{\%} of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3.6{\%} of fasting glucose, and 1.4{\%} of systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS Qualitative and quantitative pleiotropic tests on pairs of traits indicate that a small portion of the covariation in these traits can be explained by the reported common genetic variants.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies in 13,685 individuals of European ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, as part of the QTGEN consortium. We observed associations at P {\textless} 5 x 10(-8) with variants in NOS1AP, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, known to be involved in myocardial repolarization and mendelian long-QT syndromes. Associations were found at five newly identified loci, including 16q21 near NDRG4 and GINS3, 6q22 near PLN, 1p36 near RNF207, 16p13 near LITAF and 17q12 near LIG3 and RFFL. Collectively, the 14 independent variants at these 10 loci explain 5.4-6.5{\%} of the variation in QT interval. These results, together with an accompanying paper, offer insights into myocardial repolarization and suggest candidate genes that could predispose to sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias.},

We identify four new loci for coronary artery disease that reached the threshold of genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)). These loci mapped in or near TTC32-WDR35, GUCY1A3, C6orf10-BTNL2 and ATP2B1. We also replicated four loci previously identified in European populations (in or near PHACTR1, TCF21, CDKN2A-CDKN2B and C12orf51). These findings provide new insights into pathways contributing to the susceptibility for coronary artery disease in the Chinese Han population.},

abstract = {Numerous genetic loci have been associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Europeans. We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10(-8) to P = 2.3 × 10(-13)) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP.},

@article{Das2011a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal measurements with bivariate response have been analyzed by several authors using two separate models for each response. However, for most of the biological or medical experiments, the two responses are highly correlated and hence a separate model for each response might not be a desirable way to analyze such data. A single model considering a bivariate response provides a more powerful inference as the correlation between the responses is modeled appropriately. In this article, we propose a dynamic statistical model to detect the genes controlling human blood pressure (systolic and diastolic).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: By modeling the mean function with orthogonal Legendre polynomials and the covariance matrix with a stationary parametric structure, we incorporate the statistical ideas in functional genome-wide association studies to detect SNPs which have significant control on human blood pressure. The traditional false discovery rate is used for multiple comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We analyze the data from the Framingham Heart Study to detect such SNPs by appropriately considering gender-gene interaction. We detect 8 SNPs for males and 7 for females which are most significant in controlling blood pressure. The genotype-specific mean curves and additive and dominant effects over time are shown for each significant SNP for both genders. Simulation studies are performed to examine the statistical properties of our model. The current model will be extremely useful in detecting genes controlling different traits and diseases for humans or non-human subjects.},

abstract = {Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome and has become the most common reason for adult hospitalization in developed countries. Two subtypes of heart failure, ischemic heart disease (ISCH) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), have been studied using microarray platforms. However, microarray has limited resolution. Here we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify gene signatures for heart failure from six individuals, including three controls, one ISCH and two DCM patients. Using genes identified from this small RNA-Seq dataset, we were able to accurately classify heart failure status in a much larger set of 313 individuals. The identified genes significantly overlapped with genes identified via genome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic traits and the promoters of those genes were enriched for binding sites for transcriptions factors. Our results indicate that it is possible to use RNA-Seq to classify disease status for complex diseases such as heart failure using an extremely small training dataset.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are among the most significant health problems in the United States. Blood pressure (BP) variability has a genetic component, and most of the genetic variance remains to be identified. One promising strategy for gene discovery is genome-wide analysis of interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental factors related to cardiovascular diseases.

METHODS: We investigated SNP-smoking interaction effects on BP in genome-wide data in 6,889 participants from the Framingham Heart Study. We performed the standard 1 degree of freedom (df) test of the interaction effect and the joint 2 df test of main and interaction effects. Three smoking measures were used: cigarettes per day (CPD), pack years of smoking, and smoking status.

RESULTS: We identified 7 significant and 21 suggestive BP loci. Identified through the joint 2 df test, significant SBP loci include: rs12149862 (P = 3.65×10(-9)) in CYB5B, rs2268365 (P = 4.85×10(-8)) in LRP2, rs133980 (P = 1.71×10(-8) with CPD and P = 1.07×10(-8) with pack-years) near MN1, and rs12634933 (P = 4.05×10(-8)) in MECOM. Through 1 df interaction analysis, 1 suggestive SBP locus at SNP rs8010717 near NRXN3 was identified using all 3 smoking measures (P = 3.27×10(-7) with CPD, P = 1.03×10(-7) with pack-years, and P = 1.19×10(-7) with smoking status).

CONCLUSIONS: Several of these BP loci are biologically plausible, providing physiological connection to BP regulation. Our study demonstrates that SNP-smoking interactions can enhance gene discovery and provide insight into novel pathways and mechanisms regulating BP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci associated with variation in resting heart rate in European and Asian populations. No study has evaluated genetic variants associated with heart rate in African Americans.

OBJECTIVE: To identify novel genetic variants associated with resting heart rate in African Americans.

METHODS: Ten cohort studies participating in the Candidate-gene Association Resource and Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network consortia performed genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed 2,954,965 SNPs using HapMap YRI and CEU panels in 13,372 participants of African ancestry. Each study measured the RR interval (ms) from 10-second resting 12-lead electrocardiograms and estimated RR-SNP associations using covariate-adjusted linear regression. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to combine cohort-specific measures of association and identify genome-wide significant loci (P≤2.5×10(-8)).

RESULTS: Fourteen SNPs on chromosome 6q22 exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold. The most significant association was for rs9320841 (+13 ms per minor allele; P = 4.98×10(-15)). This SNP was approximately 350 kb downstream of GJA1, a locus previously identified as harboring SNPs associated with heart rate in Europeans. Adjustment for rs9320841 also attenuated the association between the remaining 13 SNPs in this region and heart rate. In addition, SNPs in MYH6, which have been identified in European genome-wide association study, were associated with similar changes in the resting heart rate as this population of African Americans.

CONCLUSIONS: An intergenic region downstream of GJA1 (the gene encoding connexin 43, the major protein of the human myocardial gap junction) and an intragenic region within MYH6 are associated with variation in resting heart rate in African Americans as well as in populations of European and Asian origin.},

abstract = {Although over 30 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified to be independently associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk variants reported to date explain only a small fraction of heritability. To identify novel susceptibility variants for CAD and confirm those previously identified in European population, GWAS and a replication study were performed in the Koreans and Japanese. In the discovery stage, we genotyped 2123 cases and 3591 controls with 521 786 SNPs using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 chips in Korean. In the replication, direct genotyping was performed using 3052 cases and 4976 controls from the KItaNagoya Genome study of Japan with 14 selected SNPs. To maximize the coverage of the genome, imputation was performed based on 1000 Genome JPT+CHB and 5.1 million SNPs were retained. CAD association was replicated for three GWAS-identified loci (1p13.3/SORT1 (rs599839), 9p21.3/CDKN2A/2B (rs4977574), and 11q22.3/ PDGFD (rs974819)) in Koreans. From GWAS and a replication, SNP rs3782889 showed a strong association (combined P=3.95 × 10(-14)), although the association of SNP rs3782889 doesn't remain statistically significant after adjusting for SNP rs11066015 (proxy SNP with BRAP (r(2)=1)). But new possible CAD-associated variant was observed for rs9508025 (FLT1), even though its statistical significance did marginally reach at the genome-wide a significance level (combined P=6.07 × 10(-7)). This study shows that three CAD susceptibility loci, which were previously identified in European can be directly replicated in Koreans and also provides additional evidences implicating suggestive loci as risk variants for CAD in East Asian.},

abstract = {Electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements vary by ancestry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci that contribute to ECG measurements; however, most are performed in Europeans collected from population-based cohorts or surveys. The strongest associations reported are in NOS1AP with QT interval and SCN10A with PR and QRS durations. The extent to which these associations can be generalized to African Americans has yet to be determined. Using electronic medical records, PR and QT intervals, QRS duration, and heart rate were determined in 455 African Americans as part of the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project and Northwestern University NUgene Project. We tested for an association between these ECG traits and {\textgreater}930K SNPs. We identified a total 36 novel associations with PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and heart rate at p {\textless} 1.0 × 10(-6). Using published GWAS data, we compared our results with those previously identified in other populations. Five associations originally identified in other populations generalized with respect to statistical significance and direction of effect. A total of 43 associations have a consistent direction of effect with European and/or Asian populations. This work provides a catalogue of generalized versus nongeneralized associations, a necessary step in prioritizing GWAS-identified regions for further fine-mapping in diverse populations.},

abstract = {Elevated resting heart rate is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In a 2-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in up to 181,171 individuals, we identified 14 new loci associated with heart rate and confirmed associations with all 7 previously established loci. Experimental downregulation of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio identified 20 genes at 11 loci that are relevant for heart rate regulation and highlight a role for genes involved in signal transmission, embryonic cardiac development and the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, congenital heart failure and/or sudden cardiac death. In addition, genetic susceptibility to increased heart rate is associated with altered cardiac conduction and reduced risk of sick sinus syndrome, and both heart rate-increasing and heart rate-decreasing variants associate with risk of atrial fibrillation. Our findings provide fresh insights into the mechanisms regulating heart rate and identify new therapeutic targets.},

To identify common genetic variants associated with sporadic non-syndromic CHM in Han Chinese populations, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a total of 4,225 CHM cases and 5,112 non-CHM controls. The GWAS stage included 945 cases and 1,246 controls and was followed by 2-stage validation with 2,160 cases and 3,866 controls.

METHODS: A Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for loci influencing BP variability was undertaken in 3802 individuals from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT) study, in which long-term visit-to-visit and within-visit BP measures were available. Because BP variability is strongly associated with ischemic stroke, we genotyped the sentinel single nucleotide polymorphism in an independent ischemic stroke population comprising 8624 cases and 12 722 controls and in 3900 additional (Scandinavian) participants from the ASCOT study to replicate our findings.

RESULTS: The ASCOT discovery GWAS identified a cluster of 17 correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NLGN1 gene (3q26.31) associated with BP variability. The strongest association was with rs976683 (P=1.4×10(-8)). Conditional analysis of rs976683 provided no evidence of additional independent associations at the locus. Analysis of rs976683 in patients with ischemic stroke found no association for overall stroke (odds ratio, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.07; P=0.52) or its subtypes: cardioembolic (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.16; P=0.17), large vessel disease (odds ratio, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.07; P=0.60), and small vessel disease (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.17; P=0.19). No evidence for association was found between rs976683 and BP variability in the additional (Scandinavian) ASCOT participants (P=0.18).

CONCLUSIONS: We identified a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms at the NLGN1 locus showing significant association with BP variability. Follow-up analyses did not support an association with risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes.},

abstract = {High blood pressure (BP) is more prevalent and contributes to more severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in African Americans than in any other United States ethnic group. Several small African-ancestry (AA) BP genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been published, but their findings have failed to replicate to date. We report on a large AA BP GWAS meta-analysis that includes 29,378 individuals from 19 discovery cohorts and subsequent replication in additional samples of AA (n = 10,386), European ancestry (EA) (n = 69,395), and East Asian ancestry (n = 19,601). Five loci (EVX1-HOXA, ULK4, RSPO3, PLEKHG1, and SOX6) reached genome-wide significance (p {\textless} 1.0 × 10(-8)) for either systolic or diastolic BP in a transethnic meta-analysis after correction for multiple testing. Three of these BP loci (EVX1-HOXA, RSPO3, and PLEKHG1) lack previous associations with BP. We also identified one independent signal in a known BP locus (SOX6) and provide evidence for fine mapping in four additional validated BP loci. We also demonstrate that validated EA BP GWAS loci, considered jointly, show significant effects in AA samples. Consequently, these findings suggest that BP loci might have universal effects across studied populations, demonstrating that multiethnic samples are an essential component in identifying, fine mapping, and understanding their trait variability.},

abstract = {We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure among 26,600 East Asian participants (stage 1) followed by replication study of up to 28,783 participants (stage 2). For novel loci, statistical significance was determined by a P{\textless}5.0×10(-8) in joint analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 data. For loci reported by the previous mean arterial and pulse pressure genome-wide association study meta-analysis in Europeans, evidence of transethnic replication was determined by consistency in effect direction and a Bonferroni-corrected P{\textless}1.4×10(-3). No novel loci were identified by the current study. Five independent mean arterial pressure variants demonstrated robust evidence for transethnic replication including rs17249754 at ATP2B1 (P=7.5×10(-15)), rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=3.4×10(-7)), rs11191593 at NT5C2 (1.1×10(-6)), rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=1.2×10(-6)), and rs13149993 at FGF5 (P=2.4×10(-4)). Two additional variants showed suggestive evidence of transethnic replication (consistency in effect direction and P{\textless}0.05), including rs319690 at MAP4 (P=0.014) and rs1173771 at NPR3 (P=0.018). For pulse pressure, robust evidence of replication was identified for 2 independent variants, including rs17249754 at ATP2B1 (P=1.2×10(-5)) and rs11191593 at NT5C2 (P=1.1×10(-3)), with suggestive evidence of replication among an additional 2 variants including rs3824755 at CYP17A1 (P=6.1×10(-3)) and rs2681492 at ATP2B1 (P=9.0×10(-3)). Replicated variants demonstrated consistency in effect sizes between East Asian and European samples, with effect size differences ranging from 0.03 to 0.24 mm Hg for mean arterial pressure and from 0.03 to 0.21 mm Hg for pulse pressure. In conclusion, we present the first evidence of transethnic replication of several mean arterial and pulse pressure loci in an East Asian population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test vary considerably among individuals. We aimed to identify novel genetic variants influencing individuals' BP responses to dietary intervention and cold pressor test.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of BP responses in 1881 Han Chinese and de novo genotyped top findings in 698 Han Chinese. Diet-feeding study included a 7-day low-sodium (51.3 mmol/d), a 7-day high-sodium (307.8 mmol/d), and a 7-day high-sodium plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol/d). Nine BP measurements were obtained during baseline observation and each intervention period. The meta-analyses identified 8 novel loci for BP phenotypes, which physically mapped in or near PRMT6 (P=7.29 × 10(-9)), CDCA7 (P=3.57 × 10(-8)), PIBF1 (P=1.78 × 10(-9)), ARL4C (P=1.86 × 10(-8)), IRAK1BP1 (P=1.44 × 10(-10)), SALL1 (P=7.01 × 10(-13)), TRPM8 (P=2.68 × 10(-8)), and FBXL13 (P=3.74 × 10(-9)). There was a strong dose-response relationship between the number of risk alleles of these independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of developing hypertension during the 7.5-year follow-up in the study participants. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of risk alleles, odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) for those in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.39 (0.97, 1.99), 1.72 (1.19, 2.47), and 1.84 (1.29, 2.62), respectively (P=0.0003 for trend).

CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified 8 novel loci for BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention and cold pressor test. The effect size of these novel loci on BP phenotypes is much larger than those reported by the previously published studies. Furthermore, these variants predict the risk of developing hypertension among individuals with normal BP at baseline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggested that resting heart rate (RHR) might be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Nonetheless, the interrelation between RHR and cardiovascular diseases is not clear. In order to resolve this puzzle, the importance of genetic determinants of RHR has been recently suggested, but it needs to be further investigated.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of common genetic variations on RHR using Genome Wide Association Study.

METHODS: We performed a Genome Wide Association Study in an isolated population cohort of 1737 individuals, the Italian Network on Genetic Isolates - Friuli Venezia Giulia (INGI-FVG). Moreover, a haplotype analysis was performed. A regression tree analysis was run to highlight the effect of each haplotype combination on the phenotype.

RESULTS: A significant level of association (p{\textless}5 × 10(-8)) was detected for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes expressed in the heart: MAML1 and CANX. Founding that the three different variants of the haplotype, which encompass both genes, yielded a phenotypic correlation. Indeed, a haplotype in homozygosity is significantly associated with the lower quartile of RHR (RHR ≤ 58 bpm). Moreover no significant association was found between cardiovascular risk factors and the different haplotype combinations.

CONCLUSION: Mastermind-like 1 and Calnexin were found to be associated with RHR. We demonstrated a relation between a haplotype and the lower quartile of RHR in our populations. Our findings highlight that genetic determinants of RHR may be implicated in determining cardiovascular diseases and could allow a better risk stratification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic loci associated with blood pressure (BP). Genetic effects on BP can be altered by environmental exposures via multiple biological pathways. Especially, obesity is one of important environmental risk factors that can have considerable effect on BP and it may interact with genetic factors. Given that, we aimed to test whether genetic factors and obesity may jointly influence BP.

METHODS: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association data for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that included analyses of interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the obesity-related anthropometric measures, body mass index (BMI), height, weight, and waist/hip ratio (WHR) in East-Asians (n = 12,030).

RESULTS: We identified that rs13390641 on 2q12.1 demonstrated significant association with SBP when the interaction between SNPs and BMI was considered (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8). The gene located nearest to rs13390641, TMEM182, encodes transmembrane protein 182. In stratified analyses, the effect of rs13390641 on BP was much stronger in obese individuals (BMI ≥ 30) than non-obese individuals and the effect of BMI on BP was strongest in individuals with the homozygous A allele of rs13390641.

CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses that included interactions between SNPs and environmental factors identified a genetic variant associated with BP that was overlooked in standard analyses in which only genetic factors were included. This result also revealed a potential mechanism that integrates genetic factors and obesity related traits in the development of high BP.},

QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain ∼8-10{\%} of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation. Several newly identified loci encode proteins that physically interact with other recognized repolarization proteins. Our integration of common variant association, expression and orthogonal protein-protein interaction screens provides new insights into cardiac electrophysiology and identifies new candidate genes for ventricular arrhythmias, LQTS and SCD.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a heritable, quantitative trait with intraindividual variability and susceptibility to measurement error. Genetic studies of BP generally use single-visit measurements and thus cannot remove variability occurring over months or years. We leveraged the idea that averaging BP measured across time would improve phenotypic accuracy and thereby increase statistical power to detect genetic associations. We studied systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) averaged over multiple years in 46,629 individuals of European ancestry. We identified 39 trait-variant associations across 19 independent loci (p {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)); five associations (in four loci) uniquely identified by our LTA analyses included those of SBP and MAP at 2p23 (rs1275988, near KCNK3), DBP at 2q11.2 (rs7599598, in FER1L5), and PP at 6p21 (rs10948071, near CRIP3) and 7p13 (rs2949837, near IGFBP3). Replication analyses conducted in cohorts with single-visit BP data showed positive replication of associations and a nominal association (p {\textless} 0.05). We estimated a 20{\%} gain in statistical power with long-term average (LTA) as compared to single-visit BP association studies. Using LTA analysis, we identified genetic loci influencing BP. LTA might be one way of increasing the power of genetic associations for continuous traits in extant samples for other phenotypes that are measured serially over time.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram has several advantages in detecting cardiac arrhythmia-it is readily available, noninvasive and cost-efficient. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with electrocardiogram measures. We performed a genome-wide association study using Korea Association Resource data for the discovery phase (Phase 1, n = 6805) and two consecutive replication studies in Japanese populations (Phase 2, n = 2285; Phase 3, n = 5010) for QRS duration and PR interval. Three novel loci were identified: rs2483280 (PRDM16 locus) and rs335206 (PRDM6 locus) were associated with QRS duration, and rs17026156 (SLC8A1 locus) correlated with PR interval. PRDM16 was recently identified as a causative gene of left ventricular non-compaction and dilated cardiomyopathy in 1p36 deletion syndrome, which is characterized by heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Thus, our finding that a PRDM16 SNP is linked to QRS duration strongly implicates PRDM16 in cardiac function. In addition, C allele of rs17026156 increases PR interval (beta ± SE, 2.39 ± 0.40 ms) and exists far more frequently in East Asians (0.46) than in Europeans and Africans (0.05 and 0.08, respectively).},

abstract = {Congenital left-sided lesions (LSLs) are serious, heritable malformations of the heart. However, little is known about the genetic causes of LSLs. This study was undertaken to identify common variants acting through the genotype of the affected individual (i.e. case) or the mother (e.g. via an in utero effect) that influence the risk of LSLs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using data from 377 LSL case-parent triads, with follow-up studies in an independent sample of 224 triads and analysis of the combined data. Associations with both the case and maternal genotypes were assessed using log-linear analyses under an additive model. An association between LSLs and the case genotype for one intergenic SNP on chromosome 16 achieved genome-wide significance in the combined data (rs8061121, combined P = 4.0 × 10(-9); relative risk to heterozygote: 2.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.9-3.7). In the combined data, there was also suggestive evidence of association between LSLs and the case genotype for a variant in the synaptoporin gene (rs1975649, combined P = 3.4 × 10(-7); relative risk to heterozygote: 1.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.4-2.0) and between LSLs and the maternal genotype for an intergenic SNP on chromosome 10 (rs11008222, combined P = 6.3 × 10(-7); relative risk to heterozygote: 1.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.4-2.0). This is the first GWAS of LSLs to evaluate associations with both the case and maternal genotypes. The results of this study identify three candidate LSL susceptibility loci, including one that appears to be associated with the risk of LSLs via the maternal genotype.},

abstract = {Hypertension is a common disorder and the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature deaths worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the European population have identified multiple chromosomal regions associated with blood pressure, and the identified loci altogether explain only a small fraction of the variance for blood pressure. The differences in environmental exposures and genetic background between Chinese and European populations might suggest potential different pathways of blood pressure regulation. To identify novel genetic variants affecting blood pressure variation, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWASs of blood pressure and hypertension in 11 816 subjects followed by replication studies including 69 146 additional individuals. We identified genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5.0 × 10(-8)) associations with blood pressure, which included variants at three new loci (CACNA1D, CYP21A2, and MED13L) and a newly discovered variant near SLC4A7. We also replicated 14 previously reported loci, 8 (CASZ1, MOV10, FGF5, CYP17A1, SOX6, ATP2B1, ALDH2, and JAG1) at genome-wide significance, and 6 (FIGN, ULK4, GUCY1A3, HFE, TBX3-TBX5, and TBX3) at a suggestive level of P = 1.81 × 10(-3) to 5.16 × 10(-8). These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and potential targets for treatments.},

Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes.

abstract = {Small-scale molecular systems biology, by which we mean the understanding of a how a few parts work together to control a particular biological process, is predicated on the assumption that cellular regulation is arranged in a circuit-like structure. Results from the omics revolution have upset this vision to varying degrees by revealing a high degree of interconnectivity, making it difficult to develop a simple, circuit-like understanding of regulatory processes. We here outline the limitations of the small-scale systems biology approach with examples from research into genetic algorithms, genetics, transcriptional network analysis, and genomics. We also discuss the difficulties associated with deriving true understanding from the analysis of large data sets and propose that the development of new, intelligent, computational tools may point to a way forward. Throughout, we intentionally oversimplify and talk about things in which we have little expertise, and it is likely that many of our arguments are wrong on one level or another. We do believe, however, that developing a true understanding via molecular systems biology will require a fundamental rethinking of our approach, and our goal is to provoke thought along these lines.},

abstract = {There are thousands of known associations between genetic variants and complex human phenotypes, and the rate of novel discoveries is rapidly increasing. Translating those associations into knowledge of disease mechanisms remains a fundamental challenge because the associated variants are overwhelmingly in noncoding regions of the genome where we have few guiding principles to predict their function. Intersecting the compendium of identified genetic associations with maps of regulatory activity across the human genome has revealed that phenotype-associated variants are highly enriched in candidate regulatory elements. Allele-specific analyses of gene regulation can further prioritize variants that likely have a functional effect on disease mechanisms; and emerging high-throughput assays to quantify the activity of candidate regulatory elements are a promising next step in that direction. Together, these technologies have created the ability to systematically and empirically test hypotheses about the function of noncoding variants and haplotypes at the scale needed for comprehensive and systematic follow-up of genetic association studies. Major coordinated efforts to quantify regulatory mechanisms across genetically diverse populations in increasingly realistic cell models would be highly beneficial to realize that potential.},

abstract = {Human genome sequencing is routine and will soon be a staple in research and clinical genetics. However, the promise of sequencing is often just that, with genome data routinely failing to reveal useful insights about disease in general or a person's health in particular. Nowhere is this chasm between promise and progress more evident than in the designation, "variant of uncertain significance" (VUS). Although it serves an important role, careful consideration of VUS reveals it to be a nebulous description of genomic information and its relationship to disease, symptomatic of our inability to make even crude quantitative assertions about the disease risks conferred by many genetic variants. In this perspective, I discuss the challenge of "variant interpretation" and the value of comparative and functional genomic information in meeting that challenge. Although already essential, genomic annotations will become even more important as our analytical focus widens beyond coding exons. Combined with more genotype and phenotype data, they will help facilitate more quantitative and insightful assessments of the contributions of genetic variants to disease.},

abstract = {With the advent of RNA-sequencing technology, we can detect different types of alternative splicing and determine how DNA variation regulates splicing. However, given the short read lengths used in most population-based RNA-sequencing experiments, quantifying transcripts accurately remains a challenge. Here we present a method, Altrans, for discovery of alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (asQTLs). To assess the performance of Altrans, we compared it to Cufflinks and MISO in simulations and Cufflinks for asQTL discovery. Simulations show that in the presence of unannotated transcripts, Altrans performs better in quantifications than Cufflinks and MISO. We have applied Altrans and Cufflinks to the Geuvadis dataset, which comprises samples from European and African populations, and discovered (FDR = 1{\%}) 1,427 and 166 asQTLs with Altrans and 1,737 and 304 asQTLs with Cufflinks for Europeans and Africans, respectively. We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (95{\%} for both methods). We find many Altrans-specific asQTLs, which replicate to a high degree (93{\%}). This is mainly due to junctions absent from the annotations and hence not tested with Cufflinks. The asQTLs are significantly enriched for biochemically active regions of the genome, functional marks, and variants in splicing regions, highlighting their biological relevance. We present an approach for discovering asQTLs that is a more direct assessment of splicing compared to other methods and is complementary to other transcript quantification methods.},

abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R2 increased from 20.1{\%} to 25.3{\%} in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8{\%} to 12.0{\%} in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10(-8) to P = 2.3 × 10(-13)) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP.},

abstract = {Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.},

The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use our method to estimate 300 genetic correlations among 25 traits, totaling more than 1.5 million unique phenotype measurements. Our results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia/ body mass index and associations between educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of a polygenic modeling framework, since there currently are no genome-wide significant SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.},

abstract = {Blood pressure is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor. To date, few variants associated with interindividual blood pressure variation have been identified and replicated. Here we report results of a genome-wide association study of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and hypertension in the CHARGE Consortium (n = 29,136), identifying 13 SNPs for SBP, 20 for DBP and 10 for hypertension at P {\textless} 4 × 10(-7). The top ten loci for SBP and DBP were incorporated into a risk score; mean BP and prevalence of hypertension increased in relation to the number of risk alleles carried. When ten CHARGE SNPs for each trait were included in a joint meta-analysis with the Global BPgen Consortium (n = 34,433), four CHARGE loci attained genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)) for SBP (ATP2B1, CYP17A1, PLEKHA7, SH2B3), six for DBP (ATP2B1, CACNB2, CSK-ULK3, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4) and one for hypertension (ATP2B1). Identifying genes associated with blood pressure advances our understanding of blood pressure regulation and highlights potential drug targets for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.},

abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that some functional categories of the genome contribute disproportionately to the heritability of complex diseases. Here we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type-specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

abstract = {We carried out a trans-ancestry genome-wide association and replication study of blood pressure phenotypes among up to 320,251 individuals of East Asian, European and South Asian ancestry. We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 × 10(-11) to 5.0 × 10(-21)). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 × 10(-6)). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation.},

@article{Silva2015,
abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements are a powerful tool for evaluating cardiac function and are widely used for the diagnosis and prediction of a variety of conditions, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified a large number of genes related to ECG parameter variability, specifically for the QT, QRS, and PR intervals. The aims of this study were to establish the heritability of ECG traits, including indices of left ventricular hypertrophy, and to directly assess the proportion of those heritabilities explained by GWAS variants. These analyses were conducted in a large, Dutch family-based cohort study, the Erasmus Rucphen Family study using variance component methods implemented in the SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines) software package. Heritability estimates ranged from 34 {\%} for QRS and Cornell voltage product to 49 {\%} for 12-lead sum. Trait-specific GWAS findings for each trait explained a fraction of their heritability (17 {\%} for QRS, 4 {\%} for QT, 2 {\%} for PR, 3 {\%} for Sokolow-Lyon index, and 4 {\%} for 12-lead sum). The inclusion of all ECG-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms explained an additional 6 {\%} of the heritability of PR. In conclusion, this study shows that, although GWAS explain a portion of ECG trait variability, a large amount of heritability remains to be explained. In addition, larger GWAS for PR are likely to detect loci already identified, particularly those observed for QRS and 12-lead sum.},

abstract = {Acute gene inactivation using short hairpin RNA (shRNA, knockdown) in developing brain is a powerful technique to study genetic function; however, discrepancies between knockdown and knockout murine phenotypes have left unanswered questions. For example, doublecortin (Dcx) knockdown but not knockout shows a neocortical neuronal migration phenotype. Here we report that in utero electroporation of shRNA, but not siRNA or miRNA, to Dcx demonstrates a migration phenotype in Dcx knockouts akin to the effect in wild-type mice, suggesting shRNA-mediated off-target toxicity. This effect was not limited to Dcx, as it was observed in Dclk1 knockouts, as well as with a fraction of scrambled shRNAs, suggesting a sequence-dependent but not sequence-specific effect. Profiling RNAs from electroporated cells showed a defect in endogenous let7 miRNA levels, and disruption of let7 or Dicer recapitulated the migration defect. The results suggest that shRNA-mediated knockdown can produce untoward migration effects by altering endogenous miRNA pathways.},

Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) {\textgreater} 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 {\textless} MAF {\textless} 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate casual genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.},

abstract = {Many complex traits studied in genetics have markedly non-normal distributions. This often implies that the assumption of normally distributed residuals has been violated. Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

abstract = {Background Genomewide association studies can be used to identify disease-relevant genomic regions, but interpretation of the data is challenging. The FTO region harbors the strongest genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis of this association remains elusive. Methods We examined epigenomic data, allelic activity, motif conservation, regulator expression, and gene coexpression patterns, with the aim of dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the association between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in samples from patients. Results Our data indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor, which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation. This results in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite) adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage. Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression, activated browning expression programs, and restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7. Conclusions Our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity effects.

abstract = {DISTANCE functions expressing the degree of dissimilarity of sets have found use in physical anthropology1, psychology2, numerical taxonomy3, ecology3 and elsewhere. During an ecological study by one of us, it was noticed that the similarity coefficient of Jaccard6, used in ecology, gives rise to a metric function satisfying the triangle inequality. For two non-empty finite sets X, Y, the Jaccard coefficient is the number of elements in the intersection X∩Y of X and Y. This coefficient (we use absolute value signs to indicate number of elements) has a heuristic interpretation.

We used tissue-specific quantitative interaction proteomics to map a network of five genes involved in the Mendelian disorder long QT syndrome (LQTS). We integrated the LQTS network with GWAS loci from the corresponding common complex trait, QT-interval variation, to identify candidate genes that were subsequently confirmed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and zebrafish. We used the LQTS protein network to filter weak GWAS signals by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in proximity to genes in the network supported by strong proteomic evidence. Three SNPs passing this filter reached genome-wide significance after replication genotyping. Overall, we present a general strategy to propose candidates in GWAS loci for functional studies and to systematically filter subtle association signals using tissue-specific quantitative interaction proteomics.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

We have developed an approach, LD Score regression, that quantifies the contribution of each by examining the relationship between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD).

abstract = {In the study of complex disease, separating causal from confounded factors is a challenge for genetic epidemiologists. One tool useful for separating these factors is Genomic Control (GC). In this communication we clarify how and when to use GC. We also describe a refined approach to GC, which should be used when GC is applied to extreme settings. Population-based studies, such as case-control studies, are common designs used to determine the genetic and environmental bases of disease. To avoid false positive associations, design and analysis of population-based studies should account for population stratification, which can inflate association test statistics. One analytic method used to control the false positive rate is GC. In our original paper1, we investigated two scenarios with two corresponding analytic methods. GC is the version similar to the typical approach to hypothesis testing, and GCB is the version that uses Bayesian inference. GC is suitable when a modest number of candidate genes are assessed and L supplementary loci are included for control. The supplementary loci, called null loci, are used to correct any inflation, , in association test statistic(s) by estimating from the null test statistics. GC produces average rejection rates close to the targeted 0.05 significance level2, 3, 4. We also considered population-based studies when large numbers of markers are tested1. GCB is designed for this scenario. Rather than preselecting null loci, GCB delineates loci associated with disease as 'outliers' relative to most of the loci tested. In our original papers1, 2, we argued that a population-based study should attempt to remove the effect of stratification by experimental design and analysis, such as by matching cases and controls for ethnicity and environmental covariates. GC then adjusts for the residual effects of stratification. Careful study design and implementation pay off in statistical power5, 6; even small stratification can have considerable consequences for large samples1, 2, 3, 4, 5.},

Traditionally, imaging genetics methods comprise two separate steps. First, image features are selected based on their relevance to the disease phenotype. Second, a set of genetic variants are identified to explain the selected features. In contrast, our method performs these tasks simultaneously to ultimately assign probabilistic measures of relevance to both genetic and imaging markers. We derive an efficient approximate inference algorithm that handles high dimensionality of imaging genetic data. We evaluate the algorithm on synthetic data and show that it outperforms traditional models. We also illustrate the application of the method on ADNI data.},

abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21{\%} more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37{\%} increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.},

abstract = {Epistasis-nonlinear genetic interactions between polymorphic loci-is the genetic basis of canalization and speciation, and epistatic interactions can be used to infer genetic networks affecting quantitative traits. However, the role that epistasis plays in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial. Here, we compared the genetic architecture of three Drosophila life history traits in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and a large outbred, advanced intercross population derived from 40 DGRP lines (Flyland). We assessed allele frequency changes between pools of individuals at the extremes of the distribution for each trait in the Flyland population by deep DNA sequencing. The genetic architecture of all traits was highly polygenic in both analyses. Surprisingly, none of the SNPs associated with the traits in Flyland replicated in the DGRP and vice versa. However, the majority of these SNPs participated in at least one epistatic interaction in the DGRP. Despite apparent additive effects at largely distinct loci in the two populations, the epistatic interactions perturbed common, biologically plausible, and highly connected genetic networks. Our analysis underscores the importance of epistasis as a principal factor that determines variation for quantitative traits and provides a means to uncover genetic networks affecting these traits. Knowledge of epistatic networks will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionarily and clinically important traits and enhance predictive ability at an individualized level in medicine and agriculture.},

We address a long-standing controversy and paradox about the contribution of non-additive genetic variation, namely that knowledge about biological pathways and gene networks imply that epistasis is important. Yet empirical data across a range of traits and species imply that most genetic variance is additive. We evaluate the evidence from empirical studies of genetic variance components and find that additive variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to 100{\%}, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this is the case even if there are non-additive effects at the level of gene action. We conclude that interactions at the level of genes are not likely to generate much interaction at the level of variance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has emerged as the standard for measuring gene expression and is an important technique often used in studies of human disease. Gene expression quantification involves comparison of the sequenced reads to a known genomic or transcriptomic reference. The accuracy of that quantification relies on there being enough unique information in the reads to enable bioinformatics tools to accurately assign the reads to the correct gene.

RESULTS: We apply 12 common methods to estimate gene expression from RNA-Seq data and show that there are hundreds of genes whose expression is underestimated by one or more of those methods. Many of these genes have been implicated in human disease, and we describe their roles. We go on to propose a two-stage analysis of RNA-Seq data in which multi-mapped or ambiguous reads can instead be uniquely assigned to groups of genes. We apply this method to a recently published mouse cancer study, and demonstrate that we can extract relevant biological signal from data that would otherwise have been discarded.

CONCLUSIONS: For hundreds of genes in the human genome, RNA-Seq is unable to measure expression accurately. These genes are enriched for gene families, and many of them have been implicated in human disease. We show that it is possible to use data that may otherwise have been discarded to measure group-level expression, and that such data contains biologically relevant information.},

The main challenge of analyzing microarray data is not in finding differentially expressed genes, but in gaining insights into the biological processes underlying phenotypic differences. To interpret experimental results from microarrays, gene set analysis (GSA) has become the method of choice, in particular because it incorporates pre-existing biological knowledge (in a form of functionally related gene sets) into the analysis. Here we provide a brief review of several statistically different GSA approaches (competitive and self-contained) that can be adapted from microarrays practice as well as those specifically designed for RNA-seq. We evaluate their performance (in terms of Type I error rate, power, robustness to the sample size and heterogeneity, as well as the sensitivity to different types of selection biases) on simulated and real RNA-seq data. Not surprisingly, the performance of various GSA approaches depends only on the statistical hypothesis they test and does not depend on whether the test was developed for microarrays or RNA-seq data. Interestingly, we found that competitive methods have lower power as well as robustness to the samples heterogeneity than self-contained methods, leading to poor results reproducibility. We also found that the power of unsupervised competitive methods depends on the balance between up- and down-regulated genes in tested gene sets. These properties of competitive methods have been overlooked before. Our evaluation provides a concise guideline for selecting GSA approaches, best performing under particular experimental settings in the context of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many traits and diseases. However, at existing sample sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated heritability. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes may improve detection without the need for larger datasets. The Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds. Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and have several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis. However, existing methods require distinct control samples between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability. Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs. We apply our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls, enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease associations across five diseases not previously declared. Our technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and establishes robust limits on the expected FDR. This approach can improve SNP detection in GWAS, and give insight into shared aetiology between phenotypically related conditions.},

abstract = {Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small RNA-sequencing experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package.},

abstract = {Many mutations cause genetic disorders. However, two people inheriting the same mutation often have different severity of symptoms, and this is partly genetic. The effects of genetic background on mutant phenotypes are poorly understood, but predicting them is critical for personalized medicine. To study this phenomenon comprehensively and systematically, we used RNAi to compare loss-of-function phenotypes for ∼1,400 genes in two isolates of C. elegans and find that ∼20{\%} of genes differ in the severity of phenotypes in these two genetic backgrounds. Crucially, this effect of genetic background on the severity of both RNAi and mutant phenotypes can be predicted from variation in the expression levels of the affected gene. This is also true in mammalian cells, suggesting it is a general property of genetic networks. We suggest that differences in the manifestation of mutant phenotypes between individuals are largely the result of natural variation in gene expression.},

Here we show that cardiac microtissues engineered from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a powerful system for evaluating the pathogenicity of titin gene variants. We found that certain missense mutations, like TTNtvs, diminish contractile performance and are pathogenic. By combining functional analyses with RNA sequencing, we explain why truncations in the A-band domain of TTN cause DCM, whereas truncations in the I band are better tolerated. Finally, we demonstrate that mutant titin protein in iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes results in sarcomere insufficiency, impaired responses to mechanical and $\beta$-adrenergic stress, and attenuated growth factor and cell signaling activation. Our findings indicate that titin mutations cause DCM by disrupting critical linkages between sarcomerogenesis and adaptive remodeling.},

abstract = {A complete reference assembly is essential for accurately interpreting individual genomes and associating variation with phenotypes. While the current human reference genome sequence is of very high quality, gaps and misassemblies remain due to biological and technical complexities. Large repetitive sequences and complex allelic diversity are the two main drivers of assembly error. Although increasing the length of sequence reads and library fragments can improve assembly, even the longest available reads do not resolve all regions. In order to overcome the issue of allelic diversity, we used genomic DNA from an essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1. We utilized several resources from this DNA including a set of end-sequenced and indexed BAC clones and 100× Illumina whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequence coverage. We used the WGS sequence and the GRCh37 reference assembly to create an assembly of the CHM1 genome. We subsequently incorporated 382 finished BAC clone sequences to generate a draft assembly, CHM1{\_}1.1 (NCBI AssemblyDB GCA{\_}000306695.2). Analysis of gene, repetitive element, and segmental duplication content show this assembly to be of excellent quality and contiguity. However, comparison to assembly-independent resources, such as BAC clone end sequences and PacBio long reads, indicate misassembled regions. Most of these regions are enriched for structural variation and segmental duplication, and can be resolved in the future. This publicly available assembly will be integrated into the Genome Reference Consortium curation framework for further improvement, with the ultimate goal being a completely finished gap-free assembly.},

A similar zebrafish phenotype was obtained with knockdown of the ortholog of TNS1, which encodes tensin 1, a focal adhesion protein involved in cytoskeleton organization. We also showed expression of tensin 1 during valve morphogenesis and describe enlarged posterior mitral leaflets in Tns1(-/-) mice.

abstract = {Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease associated with loss of tolerance to several pancreatic islet cell molecules, including insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), ICA69 and the tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 (refs 1-3). Among several predisposing loci, IDDM2 maps to the insulin gene (INS) VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) minisatellite on chromosome 11p15 (refs 4-9). Allelic variation at this VNTR locus correlates with steady-state levels of INS mRNA in pancreas and transfected rodent cell lines, but it is difficult to reconcile the association of lower INS mRNA levels in the pancreas with class III VNTRs that are dominantly protective from IDDM. We show that during fetal development and childhood, mRNAs for insulin and other islet cell autoantigens (GAD, ICA69, IA-2) are expressed at low levels in the human thymus. Critically, we also detect proinsulin and insulin protein. VNTR alleles correlate with differential INS mRNA expression in the thymus where, in contrast to the pancreas, protective class III VNTRs are associated with higher steady-state levels of INS mRNA expression. This finding provides a plausible explanation for the dominant protective effect of class III VNTRs, and suggests that diabetes susceptibility and resistance associated with IDDM2 may derive from the VNTR influence on INS transcription in the thymus. Higher levels of (pro)insulin in the thymus may promote negative selection (deletion) of insulin-specific T-lymphocytes which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of type-1 diabetes.},

abstract = {At least 20 different chromosomal regions have been linked to type 1 diabetes (T1D) susceptibility in humans, using genome screening, candidate gene testing, and studies of human homologues of mouse susceptibility genes. The largest contribution from a single locus (IDDM1) comes from several genes located in the MHC complex on chromosome 6p21.3, accounting for at least 40{\%} of the familial aggregation of this disease. Approximately 30{\%} of T1D patients are heterozygous for HLA-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201/DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 alleles (formerly referred to as HLA-DR3/4 and for simplification usually shortened to HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and a particular HLA-DQ6 molecule (HLA-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602) is associated with dominant protection from the disease. There is evidence that certain residues important for structure and function of both HLA-DQ and DR peptide-binding pockets determine disease susceptibility and resistance. Independent confirmation of the IDDM2 locus on chromosome 11p15.5 has been achieved in both case-control and family-based studies, whereas associations with the other potential IDDM loci have not always been replicated. Several possibilities to explain these variable results from different studies are discussed, and a key factor affecting both linkage and association studies is that the genetic basis of T1D susceptibility may differ between ethnic groups. Some future strategies to address these problems are proposed. These include increasing the sample size in homogenous ethnic groups, high throughput genotyping and genomewide linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping to establish disease associated ancestral haplotypes. Elucidation of the function of particular genes ('functional genomics') in the pathogenesis of T1D will be a most important element in future studies in this field, in addition to more sophisticated methods of statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is perceived as a chronic immune-mediated disease with a subclinical prodromal period characterized by selective loss of insulin-producing {\{}beta{\}}-cells in the pancreatic islets in genetically susceptible subjects. A series of evidence supports a critical role of exogenous factors in the development of type 1 diabetes, such as 1) the fact that {\textless}10{\%} of individuals with HLA-conferred diabetes susceptibility do progress to clinical disease, 2) a pairwise concordance of type 1 diabetes of {\textless}40{\%} among monozygotic twins, 3) a more than 10-fold difference in the disease incidence among Caucasians living in Europe, 4) a several-fold increase in the incidence over the last 50 years, and 5) migration studies indicating that the disease incidence has increased in population groups who have moved from a low-incidence to a high-incidence region. This article discusses the trigger-booster hypothesis claiming that the diabetic disease process is triggered by an exogenous factor with definite seasonal variation and driven by one or several other environmental determinants. In addition, there are a series of modifying factors affecting the fate and pace of the process. Accordingly, progression to clinical type 1 diabetes typically requires the unfortunate combination of genetic disease susceptibility, a diabetogenic trigger, and a high exposure to a driving antigen.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

These deeper questions have commonly been seen as the purview of religion and spirituality. This essay explores how religion and spirituality are understood in the current US context and defined in the scholarly literature over the past 100 years. It is argued that a pragmatic, functional approach to religion and spirituality is important to understanding how patients respond to genetic diagnoses and participate in genetic therapies. A pragmatic, functional approach requires broadening the inquiry to include anything that provides a framework of transcendent meaning for the fundamental existential questions of human life. This approach also entails suspending questions about the truth claims of any particular religious/spiritual belief or practice. Three implications of adopting this broad working definition will be presented.},

abstract = {We isolated a rat cDNA clone and its human orthologue, which are most homologous to UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9, by homology-based PCR from brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these putative GalNAc-transferases (designated pt-GalNAc-T) showed that they contained structural features characteristic of the GalNAc-transferase family. It was also found that human pt-GalNAc-T was identical to the gene WBSCR17, which is reported to be in the critical region of patients with Williams-Beuren Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, and to be predominantly expressed in brain and heart. In order to investigate the expression of pt-GalNAc-T in brain in more detail, we first examined that of human pt-GalNAc-T by Northern blot analysis and found the expression of the 5.0-kb mRNA to be most abundant in cerebral cortex with somewhat less abundant in cellebellum. The expression of rat pt-GalNAc-T was investigated more extensively. The brain-specific expression of 2.0-kb and 5.0-kb transcripts was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization in the adult brain revealed high levels of expression in cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Moreover, observation at high magnification revealed the expression to be associated with neurons, but not with glial cells. Analysis of the rat embryos also demonstrated that rat pt-GalNAc-T was expressed in the nervous system, including in the diencephalons, cerebellar primordium, and dorsal root ganglion. However, recombinant human pt-GalNAc-T, which was expressed in insect cells, did not glycosylate several peptides derived from mammalian mucins, suggesting that it may have a strict substrate specificity. The brain-specific expression of pt-GalNAc-T suggested its involvement in brain development, through O-glycosylation of proteins in the neurons.},

By taking into account the correlated structure of multiple traits, this joint analysis has several advantages, compared with separate analyses, for mapping QTL, including the expected improvement on the statistical power of the test for QTL and on the precision of parameter estimation. Also this joint analysis provides formal procedures to test a number of biologically interesting hypotheses concerning the nature of genetic correlations between different traits. Among the testing procedures considered are those for joint mapping, pleiotropy, QTL by environment interaction, and pleiotropy vs. close linkage. The test of pleiotropy (one pleiotropic QTL at a genome position) vs. close linkage (multiple nearby nonpleiotropic QTL) can have important implications for our understanding of the nature of genetic correlations between different traits in certain regions of a genome and also for practical applications in animal and plant breeding because one of the major goals in breeding is to break unfavorable linkage. Results of extensive simulation studies are presented to illustrate various properties of the analyses.},

abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the new types of information. The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of assessing associations between multiple related outcome variables, and a single explanatory variable of interest. This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations - that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5-10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.},

Mixed models have emerged as a general and flexible approach for correcting for population structure in GWAS. Here, we extend this linear mixed-model approach to carry out GWAS of correlated phenotypes, deriving a fully parameterized multi-trait mixed model (MTMM) that considers both the within-trait and between-trait variance components simultaneously for multiple traits. We apply this to data from a human cohort for correlated blood lipid traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 and show greatly increased power to detect pleiotropic loci that affect more than one blood lipid trait. We also apply this approach to an Arabidopsis thaliana data set for flowering measurements in two different locations, identifying loci whose effect depends on the environment.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms that affect complex traits or quantitative trait loci (QTL) often affect multiple traits. We describe two novel methods (1) for finding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with one or more traits using a multi-trait, meta-analysis, and (2) for distinguishing between a single pleiotropic QTL and multiple linked QTL. The meta-analysis uses the effect of each SNP on each of n traits, estimated in single trait genome wide association studies (GWAS). These effects are expressed as a vector of signed t-values (t) and the error covariance matrix of these t values is approximated by the correlation matrix of t-values among the traits calculated across the SNP (V). Consequently, t'V-1t is approximately distributed as a chi-squared with n degrees of freedom. An attractive feature of the meta-analysis is that it uses estimated effects of SNPs from single trait GWAS, so it can be applied to published data where individual records are not available. We demonstrate that the multi-trait method can be used to increase the power (numbers of SNPs validated in an independent population) of GWAS in a beef cattle data set including 10,191 animals genotyped for 729,068 SNPs with 32 traits recorded, including growth and reproduction traits. We can distinguish between a single pleiotropic QTL and multiple linked QTL because multiple SNPs tagging the same QTL show the same pattern of effects across traits. We confirm this finding by demonstrating that when one SNP is included in the statistical model the other SNPs have a non-significant effect. In the beef cattle data set, cluster analysis yielded four groups of QTL with similar patterns of effects across traits within a group. A linear index was used to validate SNPs having effects on multiple traits and to identify additional SNPs belonging to these four groups.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) yielded significant advances in defining the genetic architecture of complex traits and disease. Still, a major hurdle of GWAS is narrowing down multiple genetic associations to a few causal variants for functional studies. This becomes critical in multi-phenotype GWAS where detection and interpretability of complex SNP(s)-trait(s) associations are complicated by complex Linkage Disequilibrium patterns between SNPs and correlation between traits. Here we propose a computationally efficient algorithm (GUESS) to explore complex genetic-association models and maximize genetic variant detection. We integrated our algorithm with a new Bayesian strategy for multi-phenotype analysis to identify the specific contribution of each SNP to different trait combinations and study genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS). Despite the relatively small size of GHS (n = 3,175), when compared with the largest published meta-GWAS (n {\textgreater} 100,000), GUESS recovered most of the major associations and was better at refining multi-trait associations than alternative methods. Amongst the new findings provided by GUESS, we revealed a strong association of SORT1 with TG-APOB and LIPC with TG-HDL phenotypic groups, which were overlooked in the larger meta-GWAS and not revealed by competing approaches, associations that we replicated in two independent cohorts. Moreover, we demonstrated the increased power of GUESS over alternative multi-phenotype approaches, both Bayesian and non-Bayesian, in a simulation study that mimics real-case scenarios. We showed that our parallel implementation based on Graphics Processing Units outperforms alternative multi-phenotype methods. Beyond multivariate modelling of multi-phenotypes, our Bayesian model employs a flexible hierarchical prior structure for genetic effects that adapts to any correlation structure of the predictors and increases the power to identify associated variants. This provides a powerful tool for the analysis of diverse genomic features, for instance including gene expression and exome sequencing data, where complex dependencies are present in the predictor space.},

abstract = {Many human traits are highly correlated. This correlation can be leveraged to improve the power of genetic association tests to identify markers associated with one or more of the traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool that has been widely used for the multivariate analysis of correlated variables. PCA is usually applied as a dimension reduction method: the few top principal components (PCs) explaining most of total trait variance are tested for association with a predictor of interest, and the remaining components are not analyzed. In this study we review the theoretical basis of PCA and describe the behavior of PCA when testing for association between a SNP and correlated traits. We then use simulation to compare the power of various PCA-based strategies when analyzing up to 100 correlated traits. We show that contrary to widespread practice, testing only the top PCs often has low power, whereas combining signal across all PCs can have greater power. This power gain is primarily due to increased power to detect genetic variants with opposite effects on positively correlated traits and variants that are exclusively associated with a single trait. Relative to other methods, the combined-PC approach has close to optimal power in all scenarios considered while offering more flexibility and more robustness to potential confounders. Finally, we apply the proposed PCA strategy to the genome-wide association study of five correlated coagulation traits where we identify two candidate SNPs that were not found by the standard approach.},

Most of our knowledge of how pGE is controlled comes from studies on the autoimmune regulator (Aire). Aire activates the expression of a large subset of TRAs by interacting with the general transcriptional machinery and promoting transcript elongation. However, further factors regulating Aire-independent TRAs must be at play. Recent studies demonstrated that pGE in general and the function of Aire in particular are controlled by epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of the regulation of pGE by miRNA and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromosomal topology.},

abstract = {Population stratification is an important potential confounder of genetic case-control association studies. For replication studies, limited availability of samples may lead to imbalanced sampling from heterogeneous populations. Genomic control (GC) can be used to correct chi(2) test statistics which are presumed to be inflated by a factor lambda; this may be estimated by a summary chi(2) value (lambda(median) or lambda(mean)) from a set of unlinked markers. Many studies applying GC methods have used fewer than 50 unlinked markers and an important question is whether this can adequately correct for population stratification. We assess the behavior of GC methods in imbalanced case-control studies using simulation. SNPs are sampled from two subpopulations with intra-continental levels of FST ({\textless} or =0.005) and sampling schemata ranging from balanced to completely imbalanced between subpopulations. The sampling properties of lambda(median) and lambda(mean) are explored using 6-1,600 unlinked markers to estimate Type 1 error and power empirically. GC corrections based on the chi(2)-distribution (GC(median) or GC(mean)) can be anti-conservative even when more than 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genotyped and realistic levels of population stratification exist. The GCF procedure performs well over a wider range of conditions, only becoming anti-conservative at low levels of alpha and with fewer than 25 SNPs genotyped. A substantial loss of power can arise when population stratification is present, but this is largely independent of the number of SNPs used. A literature survey shows that most studies applying GC have used GC(median) or GC(mean), rather than GCF, which is the most appropriate GC correction method.},

abstract = {Large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping are being used to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population substructure can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We review two methods, called genomic control (GC) and structured association (SA), that obviate many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generates "over dispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The SA approach assumes that the sampled population, although heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, this "latent class method" estimates the probability sampled individuals derive from each of these latent subpopulations. GC has the advantage of robustness, simplicity, and wide applicability, even to experimental designs such as DNA pooling. SA is a bit more complicated but has the advantage of greater power in some realistic settings, such as admixed populations or when association varies widely across subpopulations. It, too, is widely applicable. Both also have weaknesses, as elaborated in our review.},

abstract = {Although association analysis is a useful tool for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, its utility is diminished by population substructure, which can produce spurious association between phenotype and genotype within population-based samples. Because family-based designs are robust against substructure, they have risen to the fore of association analysis. Yet, if population substructure could be ignored, this robustness can come at the price of power. Unfortunately it is rarely evident when population substructure can be ignored. Devlin and Roeder recently have proposed a method, termed "genomic control" (GC), which has the robustness of family-based designs even though it uses population-based data. GC uses the genome itself to determine appropriate corrections for population-based association tests. Using the GC method, we contrast the power of two study designs, family trios (i.e., father, mother, and affected progeny) versus case-control. For analysis of trios, we use the TDT test. When population substructure is absent, we find GC is always more powerful than TDT; furthermore, contrary to previous results, we show that as a disease becomes more prevalent the discrepancy in power becomes more extreme. When population substructure is present, however, the results are more complex: TDT is more powerful when population substructure is substantial, and GC is more powerful otherwise. We also explore general issues of power and implementation of GC within the case-control setting and find that, economically, GC is at least comparable to and often less expensive than family-based methods. Therefore, GC methods should prove a useful complement to family-based methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits.},

Devlin and Roeder [1999: Biometrics 55:997-1004] introduced genomic control, a statistical method that overcomes a drawback to the use of population-based samples for tests of association, namely spurious associations induced by population structure. In essence, genomic control (GC) uses markers throughout the genome to adjust for any inflation in test statistics due to substructure. To date, genomic control (GC) has been developed for binary traits and bi- or multiallelic markers. Tests of association using GC have been limited to single genes. In this report, we generalize GC to quantitative traits (QT) and multilocus models. Using statistical analysis and simulations, we show that GC controls spurious associations in reasonable settings of population substructure for QT models, including gene-gene interaction. Through simulations, we explore GC power for both random and selected samples, assuming the QT locus tested is causal and its specific heritability is 2.5-5{\%}. We find that GC, combined with either random or selected samples, has good power in this setting, and that more complex models induce smaller GC corrections. The latter suggests greater power can be achieved by specifying more complex genetic models, but this observation only follows when such models are largely correct and specified a priori.},

abstract = {Population-based case-control studies are a useful method to test for a genetic association between a trait and a marker. However, the analysis of the resulting data can be affected by population stratification or cryptic relatedness, which may inflate the variance of the usual statistics, resulting in a higher-than-nominal rate of false-positive results. One approach to preserving the nominal type I error is to apply genomic control, which adjusts the variance of the Cochran-Armitage trend test by calculating the statistic on data from null loci. This enables one to estimate any additional variance in the null distribution of statistics. When the underlying genetic model (e.g., recessive, additive, or dominant) is known, genomic control can be applied to the corresponding optimal trend tests. In practice, however, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The genotype-based chi (2) test for a general association between the trait and the marker does not depend on the underlying genetic model. Since this general association test has 2 degrees of freedom (df), the existing formulas for estimating the variance factor by use of genomic control are not directly applicable. By expressing the general association test in terms of two Cochran-Armitage trend tests, one can apply genomic control to each of the two trend tests separately, thereby adjusting the chi (2) statistic. The properties of this robust genomic control test with 2 df are examined by simulation. This genomic control-adjusted 2-df test has control of type I error and achieves reasonable power, relative to the optimal tests for each model.},

Usually, the scaled median or mean test statistic for association calculated from multiple single-nucleotide-polymorphisms across the genome is used to assess such effects, and 'genomic control' can be applied subsequently to adjust test statistics at individual loci by a genomic inflation factor. Published GWAS have clearly shown that there are many loci underlying genetic variation for a wide range of complex diseases and traits, implying that a substantial proportion of the genome should show inflation of the test statistic. Here, we show by theory, simulation and analysis of data that in the absence of population structure and other technical artefacts, but in the presence of polygenic inheritance, substantial genomic inflation is expected. Its magnitude depends on sample size, heritability, linkage disequilibrium structure and the number of causal variants. Our predictions are consistent with empirical observations on height in independent samples of {\~{}}4000 and {\~{}}133,000 individuals.},

Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high LD in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for computing LD-adjusted kinships.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of large-scale genome-wide association studies have been published for human traits adjusted for other correlated traits with a genetic basis. In most studies, the motivation for such an adjustment is to discover genetic variants associated with the primary outcome independently of the correlated trait. In this report, we contend that this objective is fulfilled when the tested variants have no effect on the covariate or when the correlation between the covariate and the outcome is fully explained by a direct effect of the covariate on the outcome. For all other scenarios, an unintended bias is introduced with respect to the primary outcome as a result of the adjustment, and this bias might lead to false positives. Here, we illustrate this point by providing examples from published genome-wide association studies, including large meta-analysis of waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference adjusted for body mass index (BMI), where genetic effects might be biased as a result of adjustment for body mass index. Using both theory and simulations, we explore this phenomenon in detail and discuss the ramifications for future genome-wide association studies of correlated traits and diseases.},

abstract = {Human olfactory perception differs enormously between individuals, with large reported perceptual variations in the intensity and pleasantness of a given odour. For instance, androstenone (5alpha-androst-16-en-3-one), an odorous steroid derived from testosterone, is variously perceived by different individuals as offensive ("sweaty, urinous"), pleasant ("sweet, floral") or odourless. Similar variation in odour perception has been observed for several other odours. The mechanistic basis of variation in odour perception between individuals is unknown. We investigated whether genetic variation in human odorant receptor genes accounts in part for variation in odour perception between individuals. Here we show that a human odorant receptor, OR7D4, is selectively activated in vitro by androstenone and the related odorous steroid androstadienone (androsta-4,16-dien-3-one) and does not respond to a panel of 64 other odours and two solvents. A common variant of this receptor (OR7D4 WM) contains two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in two amino acid substitutions (R88W, T133M; hence 'RT') that severely impair function in vitro. Human subjects with RT/WM or WM/WM genotypes as a group were less sensitive to androstenone and androstadienone and found both odours less unpleasant than the RT/RT group. Genotypic variation in OR7D4 accounts for a significant proportion of the valence (pleasantness or unpleasantness) and intensity variance in perception of these steroidal odours. Our results demonstrate the first link between the function of a human odorant receptor in vitro and odour perception.},

abstract = {Teleosts comprise more than half of all vertebrate species and have adapted to a variety of marine and freshwater habitats. Their genome evolution and diversification are important subjects for the understanding of vertebrate evolution. Although draft genome sequences of two pufferfishes have been published, analysis of more fish genomes is desirable. Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of a small egg-laying freshwater teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes). Medaka is native to East Asia and an excellent model system for a wide range of biology, including ecotoxicology, carcinogenesis, sex determination and developmental genetics. In the assembled medaka genome (700 megabases), which is less than half of the zebrafish genome, we predicted 20,141 genes, including approximately 2,900 new genes, using 5'-end serial analysis of gene expression tag information. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at an average rate of 3.42{\%} between the two inbred strains derived from two regional populations; this is the highest SNP rate seen in any vertebrate species. Analyses based on the dense SNP information show a strict genetic separation of 4 million years (Myr) between the two populations, and suggest that differential selective pressures acted on specific gene categories. Four-way comparisons with the human, pufferfish (Tetraodon), zebrafish and medaka genomes revealed that eight major interchromosomal rearrangements took place in a remarkably short period of approximately 50 Myr after the whole-genome duplication event in the teleost ancestor and afterwards, intriguingly, the medaka genome preserved its ancestral karyotype for more than 300 Myr.},

abstract = {Many correlated disease variables are analyzed jointly in genetic studies in the hope of increasing power to detect causal genetic variants. One approach involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and each SNP individually and using a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a multivariate regression or a dimension reduction technique, such as principal component analysis, and test for the association with the principal components of the phenotypes rather than the individual phenotypes. Inspired by the previous approaches of combining phenotypes to maximize heritability at individual SNPs, in this paper, we propose to construct a maximally heritable (MaxH) phenotype by taking advantage of the estimated total heritability and co-heritability. The heritability and co-heritability only need to be estimated once; therefore, our method is applicable to genome-wide scans. The MaxH phenotype is a linear combination of the individual phenotypes with increased heritability and power over the phenotypes being combined. Simulations show that the heritability and power achieved agree well with the theory for large samples and two phenotypes. We compare our approach with commonly used methods and assess both the heritability and the power of the MaxH phenotype. Moreover, we provide suggestions for how to choose the phenotypes for combination. An application of our approach to a GWAS on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease shows its practical relevance. {\textcopyright} 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

RESULTS: We developed a Personal Genome Editor (perEditor) that changes the reference human genome (NCBI36/hg18) into an individual genome, taking into account single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions, copy number variation, and chromosomal rearrangements. perEditor outputs two alleles (maternal, paternal) of the individual genome that is ready for mapping ChIP-seq and RNA-seq reads, and enabling the analyses of allele specific binding, chromatin structure and gene expression.

abstract = {Oryzias latipes (medaka) has been established as a vertebrate genetic model for more than a century and recently has been rediscovered outside its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to reinvigorate medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic panel derived from a single wild population. Here we characterize the genomes of wild medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near-isogenic panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental population structure and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties suitable for the establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will be feasible in the panel. In addition, high-throughput genome sequencing of these medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern medaka population since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that the Southern Japanese medaka existed as a larger older population that went through a relatively recent bottleneck approximately 10,000 years ago. In addition, we detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population. These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu medaka samples is suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near-isogenic panel and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced. Progress of this project can be tracked at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/birney-srv/medaka-ref-panel.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.

RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Four traits are associated with a functional variant in the Ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) gene, a key regulator of embryonic skin appendage development. We confirm expression of Edar in the developing mouse ear and that Edar-deficient mice have an abnormally shaped pinna. Two traits are associated with SNPs in a region overlapping the T-Box Protein 15 (TBX15) gene, a major determinant of mouse skeletal development. Strongest association in this region is observed for SNP rs17023457 located in an evolutionarily conserved binding site for the transcription factor Cartilage paired-class homeoprotein 1 (CART1), and we confirm that rs17023457 alters in vitro binding of CART1.},

Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales. Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One aspect in which RNA sequencing is more valuable than microarray-based methods is the ability to examine the allelic imbalance of the expression of a gene. This process is often a complex task that entails quality control, alignment, and the counting of reads over heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Allelic imbalance analysis is subject to technical biases, due to differences in the sequences of the measured alleles. Flexible bioinformatics tools are needed to ease the workflow while retaining as much RNA sequencing information as possible throughout the analysis to detect and address the possible biases.

RESULTS: We present AllelicImblance, a software program that is designed to detect, manage, and visualize allelic imbalances comprehensively. The purpose of this software is to allow users to pose genetic questions in any RNA sequencing experiment quickly, enhancing the general utility of RNA sequencing. The visualization features can reveal notable, non-trivial allelic imbalance behavior over specific regions, such as exons.

CONCLUSIONS: The software provides a complete framework to perform allelic imbalance analyses of aligned RNA sequencing data, from detection to visualization, within the robust and versatile management class, ASEset.},

abstract = {We report the genomic DNA sequence of a single chromosome (linkage group 22; LG22) of the small teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a first whole chromosome sequence from a non-mammalian vertebrate. The order and orientation of 633 protein-coding genes were deduced from 18,803,338 bp of DNA sequence, providing the opportunity to analyze chromosome evolution of vertebrate genomes by direct comparison with the human genome. The average number of genes in the "conserved gene cluster" (CGC), a strict definition of "synteny" at the sequence basis, between medaka and human was 1.6. These and other data suggest that approximately 38.8{\%} of pair-wise gene relationships would have been broken from their common ancestor in the human and medaka lineages and further imply that approx 20,000 (15,520-23,280) breaks would have occurred from the entire genome of the common ancestor. These breaks were generated mainly by intra-chromosomal shufflings at a specific era in the vertebrate lineage. These precise comparative genomics allowed us to identify the pieces of ancient chromosomes of the common vertebrate ancestor and estimate chromosomal evolution in the vertebrate lineage.},

abstract = {Both obesity and being underweight have been associated with increased mortality. Underweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 18.5 kg per m(2) in adults and ≤ -2 standard deviations from the mean in children, is the main sign of a series of heterogeneous clinical conditions including failure to thrive, feeding and eating disorder and/or anorexia nervosa. In contrast to obesity, few genetic variants underlying these clinical conditions have been reported. We previously showed that hemizygosity of a ∼600-kilobase (kb) region on the short arm of chromosome 16 causes a highly penetrant form of obesity that is often associated with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities. Here we show that the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with being underweight. We identified 138 duplication carriers (including 132 novel cases and 108 unrelated carriers) from individuals clinically referred for developmental or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) or psychiatric disorders, or recruited from population-based cohorts. These carriers show significantly reduced postnatal weight and BMI. Half of the boys younger than five years are underweight with a probable diagnosis of failure to thrive, whereas adult duplication carriers have an 8.3-fold increased risk of being clinically underweight. We observe a trend towards increased severity in males, as well as a depletion of male carriers among non-medically ascertained cases. These features are associated with an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive eating behaviours and a significant reduction in head circumference. Each of the observed phenotypes is the converse of one reported in carriers of deletions at this locus. The phenotypes correlate with changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the duplication but not in flanking regions. The reciprocal impact of these 16p11.2 copy-number variants indicates that severe obesity and being underweight could have mirror aetiologies, possibly through contrasting effects on energy balance.},

abstract = {p-Values from tests of significance can be combined using the Sid{\'{a}}k correction (or the closely related Bonferroni correction) or Fisher's method, but both these methods require that the p-values combined be independent when all null hypotheses tested are true. In this paper adjustments to these methods are proposed, using a new eigenvalue-based measure of the effective number of independent tests to which the actual tests performed are equivalent, and are compared with adjustments proposed by previous authors. The adjusted methods are evaluated using a sample of 726 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and 707 group-matched controls, genotyped at 84,975 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in 2,000 randomly chosen genes. The tests for genetic association with AD at loci within each gene are combined. The number of loci tested per gene varies from 2 to 994. The adjusted combined p-values agree well with the significance of the combined p-values determined empirically by random permutation of the data (Sid{\'{a}}k correction: r=0.990; Fisher's method: r=0.994). This indicates that the combined p-values can be used to assess the relative strength of evidence for association of these genes with AD. The adjustment proposed here is a refinement of that of Nyholt ([2004] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 74:765-769), giving improved agreement with the results of random permutation. The improvement obtained is similar to that given by the refinement proposed by Li and Ji ([2005] Heredity 95:221-227). It is concluded that the concept of an effective number of tests is a valid approximation that allows p-values to be combined in a highly informative way.},

In each of these applications, the LMM uses a genetic similarity matrix, which encodes the pairwise similarity between every two individuals in a cohort.

The performance metrics suite is applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An interlaboratory study using identical samples shared among 12 laboratories with three different measurement processes demonstrates generally consistent diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias are also comparable among laboratories for the same measurement process.

abstract = {It is now known that unwanted noise and unmodeled artifacts such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with {\textgreater}80{\%} validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR.

@article{Aschard2014a,
abstract = {Many human traits are highly correlated. This correlation can be leveraged to improve the power of genetic association tests to identify markers associated with one or more of the traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool that has been widely used for the multivariate analysis of correlated variables. PCA is usually applied as a dimension reduction method: the few top principal components (PCs) explaining most of total trait variance are tested for association with a predictor of interest, and the remaining components are not analyzed. In this study we review the theoretical basis of PCA and describe the behavior of PCA when testing for association between a SNP and correlated traits. We then use simulation to compare the power of various PCA-based strategies when analyzing up to 100 correlated traits. We show that contrary to widespread practice, testing only the top PCs often has low power, whereas combining signal across all PCs can have greater power. This power gain is primarily due to increased power to detect genetic variants with opposite effects on positively correlated traits and variants that are exclusively associated with a single trait. Relative to other methods, the combined-PC approach has close to optimal power in all scenarios considered while offering more flexibility and more robustness to potential confounders. Finally, we apply the proposed PCA strategy to the genome-wide association study of five correlated coagulation traits where we identify two candidate SNPs that were not found by the standard approach.},

abstract = {When cellular traits are measured using high-throughput DNA sequencing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) manifest at two levels: population level differences between individuals and allelic differences between cis-haplotypes within individuals. We present RASQUAL (Robust Allele Specific QUAntitation and quality controL), a novel statistical approach for association mapping that integrates genetic effects and robust modelling of biases in next generation sequencing (NGS) data within a single, probabilistic framework. RASQUAL substantially improves causal variant localisation and sensitivity of association detection over existing methods in RNA-seq, DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximise association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,706 independent caQTLs (FDR 10{\%}) and illustrate how RASQUAL's improved causal variant localisation provides powerful information for fine-mapping disease-associated variants. We also map “multipeak” caQTLs, identical genetic associations found across multiple, independent open chromatin regions and illustrate how genetic signals in ATAC-seq data can be used to link distal regulatory elements with gene promoters. Our results highlight how joint modelling of population and allele-specific genetic signals can improve functional interpretation of noncoding variation.},

Traditionally, imaging genetics methods comprise two separate steps. First, image features are selected based on their relevance to the disease phenotype. Second, a set of genetic variants are identified to explain the selected features. In contrast, our method performs these tasks simultaneously to ultimately assign probabilistic measures of relevance to both genetic and imaging markers. We derive an efficient approximate inference algorithm that handles high dimensionality of imaging genetic data. We evaluate the algorithm on synthetic data and show that it outperforms traditional models. We also illustrate the application of the method on ADNI data.},

abstract = {Aberrant connectivity is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, other than a few disease-associated candidate genes, we know little about the degree to which genetics play a role in the brain networks; we know even less about specific genes that influence brain connections. Twin and family-based studies can generate estimates of overall genetic influences on a trait, but genome-wide association scans (GWASs) can screen the genome for specific variants influencing the brain or risk for disease. To identify the heritability of various brain connections, we scanned healthy young adult twins with high-field, high-angular resolution diffusion MRI. We adapted GWASs to screen the brain's connectivity pattern, allowing us to discover genetic variants that affect the human brain's wiring. The association of connectivity with the SPON1 variant at rs2618516 on chromosome 11 (11p15.2) reached connectome-wide, genome-wide significance after stringent statistical corrections were enforced, and it was replicated in an independent subsample. rs2618516 was shown to affect brain structure in an elderly population with varying degrees of dementia. Older people who carried the connectivity variant had significantly milder clinical dementia scores and lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. As a posthoc analysis, we conducted GWASs on several organizational and topological network measures derived from the matrices to discover variants in and around genes associated with autism (MACROD2), development (NEDD4), and mental retardation (UBE2A) significantly associated with connectivity. Connectome-wide, genome-wide screening offers substantial promise to discover genes affecting brain connectivity and risk for brain diseases.},

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p{\textless}10(-7) and p{\textless}10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of AD.

With {\textgreater}1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers had an average brain volume difference of approximately 8{\%} in the frontal lobes and 12{\%} in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or the volume of white matter hyperintensities; which were not detectably higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health of the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Common variants in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been shown to influence social and affective behavior and to moderate the effect of adverse experiences on risk for social-affective problems. However, the intermediate neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Although human functional neuroimaging studies have reported that oxytocin effects on social behavior and emotional states are mediated by amygdala function, animal models indicate that oxytocin receptors in the ventral striatum (VS) modulate sensitivity to social reinforcers. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate OXTR-dependent brain mechanisms associated with social-affective problems.

METHODS: In a sample of 1445 adolescents we tested the effect of 23-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms across the OXTR region and stressful life events (SLEs) on functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent activity in the VS and amygdala to animated angry faces. Single nucleotide polymorphisms for which gene-wide significant effects on brain function were found were then carried forward to examine associations with social-affective problems.

RESULTS: A gene-wide significant effect of rs237915 showed that adolescents with minor CC-genotype had significantly lower VS activity than CT/TT-carriers. Significant or nominally significant gene × environment effects on emotional problems (in girls) and peer problems (in boys) revealed a strong increase in clinical symptoms as a function of SLEs in CT/TT-carriers but not CC-homozygotes. However, in low-SLE environments, CC-homozygotes had more emotional problems (girls) and peer problems (boys). Moreover, among CC-homozygotes, reduced VS activity was related to more peer problems.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a common OXTR-variant affects brain responsiveness to negative social cues and that in "risk-carriers" reduced sensitivity is simultaneously associated with more social-affective problems in "favorable environments" and greater resilience against stressful experiences.},

Brain activity was studied both at rest and during an encoding memory paradigm using blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Resting fMRI revealed increased "default mode network" (involving retrosplenial, medial temporal, and medial-prefrontal cortical areas) coactivation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. The encoding task produced greater hippocampal activation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. Neither result could be explained by differences in memory performance, brain morphology, or resting cerebral blood flow. The APOE epsilon4 allele modulates brain function decades before any clinical or neurophysiological expression of neurodegenerative processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by deficits in reward sensitivity and response inhibition. The relative contribution of these frontostriatal mechanisms to ADHD symptoms and their genetic determinants is largely unexplored.

METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and genetic analysis of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, we investigated how striatal and inferior frontal activation patterns contribute to ADHD symptoms depending on MAOA genotype in a sample of adolescent boys (n = 190).

RESULTS: We demonstrate an association of ADHD symptoms with distinct blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses depending on MAOA genotype. In A hemizygotes of the expression single nucleotide polymorphism rs12843268, which express lower levels of MAOA, ADHD symptoms are associated with lower ventral striatal BOLD response during the monetary incentive delay task and lower inferior frontal gyrus BOLD response during the stop signal task. In G hemizygotes, ADHD symptoms are associated with increased inferior frontal gyrus BOLD response during the stop signal task in the presence of increased ventral striatal BOLD response during the monetary incentive delay task.

CONCLUSIONS: Depending on MAOA genotype, ADHD symptoms in adolescent boys are associated with either reward deficiency or insufficient response inhibition. Apart from its mechanistic interest, our finding may aid in developing pharmacogenetic markers for ADHD.},

abstract = {Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward-and successful-genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics.},

abstract = {Enormous progress in mapping complex traits in humans has been made in the last 5 yr. There has been early success for prevalent diseases with complex phenotypes. These studies have demonstrated clearly that, while complex traits differ in their underlying genetic architectures, for many common disorders the predominant pattern is that of many loci, individually with small effects on phenotype. For some traits, loci of large effect have been identified. For almost all complex traits studied in humans, the sum of the identified genetic effects comprises only a portion, generally less than half, of the estimated trait heritability. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this might be the case, including untested rare variants, and gene-gene and gene-environment interaction. Effort is currently being directed toward implementation of novel analytic approaches and testing rare variants for association with complex traits using imputed variants from the publicly available 1000 Genomes Project resequencing data and from direct resequencing of clinical samples. Through integration with annotations and functional genomic data as well as by in vitro and in vivo experimentation, mapping studies continue to characterize functional variants associated with complex traits and address fundamental issues such as epistasis and pleiotropy. This review focuses primarily on the ways in which genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized the field of human quantitative genetics.},

abstract = {Pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes varies both within and between human populations. Identifying the genes and alleles underlying this variation has been the goal of many candidate gene and several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most GWAS for pigmentary traits to date have been based on subjective phenotypes using categorical scales. But skin, hair, and eye pigmentation vary continuously. Here, we seek to characterize quantitative variation in these traits objectively and accurately and to determine their genetic basis. Objective and quantitative measures of skin, hair, and eye color were made using reflectance or digital spectroscopy in Europeans from Ireland, Poland, Italy, and Portugal. A GWAS was conducted for the three quantitative pigmentation phenotypes in 176 women across 313,763 SNP loci, and replication of the most significant associations was attempted in a sample of 294 European men and women from the same countries. We find that the pigmentation phenotypes are highly stratified along axes of European genetic differentiation. The country of sampling explains approximately 35{\%} of the variation in skin pigmentation, 31{\%} of the variation in hair pigmentation, and 40{\%} of the variation in eye pigmentation. All three quantitative phenotypes are correlated with each other. In our two-stage association study, we reproduce the association of rs1667394 at the OCA2/HERC2 locus with eye color but we do not identify new genetic determinants of skin and hair pigmentation supporting the lack of major genes affecting skin and hair color variation within Europe and suggesting that not only careful phenotyping but also larger cohorts are required to understand the genetic architecture of these complex quantitative traits. Interestingly, we also see that in each of these four populations, men are more lightly pigmented in the unexposed skin of the inner arm than women, a fact that is underappreciated and may vary across the world.},

We used tissue-specific quantitative interaction proteomics to map a network of five genes involved in the Mendelian disorder long QT syndrome (LQTS). We integrated the LQTS network with GWAS loci from the corresponding common complex trait, QT-interval variation, to identify candidate genes that were subsequently confirmed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and zebrafish. We used the LQTS protein network to filter weak GWAS signals by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in proximity to genes in the network supported by strong proteomic evidence. Three SNPs passing this filter reached genome-wide significance after replication genotyping. Overall, we present a general strategy to propose candidates in GWAS loci for functional studies and to systematically filter subtle association signals using tissue-specific quantitative interaction proteomics.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are the method most often used by geneticists to interrogate the human genome, and they provide a cost-effective way to identify the genetic variants underpinning complex traits and diseases. Most initial GWASs have focused on genetically homogeneous cohorts from European populations given the limited availability of ethnic minority samples and so as to limit population stratification effects. Transethnic studies have been invaluable in explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits, such as height, and in examining the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. They provide an opportunity for large-scale signal replication in independent populations and for cross-population meta-analyses to boost statistical power. In addition, transethnic GWASs enable prioritization of candidate genes, fine-mapping of functional variants, and potentially identification of SNPs associated with disease risk in admixed populations, by taking advantage of natural differences in genomic linkage disequilibrium across ethnically diverse populations. Recent efforts to assess the biological function of variants identified by GWAS have highlighted the need for large-scale replication, meta-analyses and fine-mapping across worldwide populations of ethnically diverse genetic ancestries. Here, we review recent advances and new approaches that are important to consider when performing, designing or interpreting transethnic GWASs, and we highlight existing challenges, such as the limited ability to handle heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium across populations and limitations in dissecting complex architectures, such as those found in recently admixed populations.},

abstract = {Efficient power calculation methods have previously been suggested for Wald test-based inference in mixed-effects models but the only available alternative for Likelihood ratio test-based hypothesis testing has been to perform computer-intensive multiple simulations and re-estimations. The proposed Monte Carlo Mapped Power (MCMP) method is based on the use of the difference in individual objective function values ($\Delta$iOFV) derived from a large dataset simulated from a full model and subsequently re-estimated with the full and reduced models. The $\Delta$iOFV is sampled and summed (∑$\Delta$iOFVs) for each study at each sample size of interest to study, and the percentage of ∑$\Delta$iOFVs greater than the significance criterion is taken as the power. The power versus sample size relationship established via the MCMP method was compared to traditional assessment of model-based power for six different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models and designs. In each case, 1,000 simulated datasets were analysed with the full and reduced models. There was concordance in power between the traditional and MCMP methods such that for 90{\%} power, the difference in required sample size was in most investigated cases less than 10{\%}. The MCMP method was able to provide relevant power information for a representative pharmacometric model at less than 1{\%} of the run-time of an SSE. The suggested MCMP method provides a fast and accurate prediction of the power and sample size relationship.},

abstract = {The development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is under strong genetic control and there is great interest in the genetic variants that confer increased risk. The Alzheimer's disease risk gene, growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein (GAB2), has been shown to provide a 1.27-1.51 increased odds of developing LOAD for rs7101429 major allele carriers, in case-control analysis. GAB2 is expressed across the brain throughout life, and its role in LOAD pathology is well understood. Recent studies have begun to examine the effect of genetic variation in the GAB2 gene on differences in the brain. However, the effect of GAB2 on the young adult brain has yet to be considered. Here we found a significant association between the GAB2 gene and morphological brain differences in 755 young adult twins (469 females) (M = 23.1, SD = 3.1 years), using a gene-based test with principal components regression (PCReg). Detectable differences in brain morphology are therefore associated with variation in the GAB2 gene, even in young adults, long before the typical age of onset of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of {\textless}4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P {\textless} 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.},

abstract = {Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10(-7)).},

abstract = {Background Circulating cell-free fetal DNA has enabled non-invasive prenatal fetal aneuploidy testing without direct discrimination of the maternal and fetal DNA. Testing may be improved by specifically enriching the sample material for fetal DNA. DNA methylation may allow for such a separation of DNA; however, this depends on knowledge of the methylomes of circulating cell-free DNA and its cellular contributors. Results We perform whole genome bisulfite sequencing on a set of unmatched samples including circulating cell-free DNA from non-pregnant and pregnant female donors and genomic DNA from maternal buffy coat and placenta samples. We find CpG cytosines within longer fragments are more likely to be methylated. Comparison of the methylomes of placenta and non-pregnant circulating cell-free DNA reveal many of the 51,259 identified differentially methylated regions are located in domains exhibiting consistent placenta hypomethylation across millions of consecutive bases. We find these placenta hypomethylated domains are consistently located within regions exhibiting low CpG and gene density. Differentially methylated regions identified when comparing placenta to non-pregnant circulating cell-free DNA are recapitulated in pregnant circulating cell-free DNA, confirming the ability to detect differential methylation in circulating cell-free DNA mixtures. Conclusions We generate methylome maps for four sample types at single-base resolution, identify a link between DNA methylation and fragment length in circulating cell-free DNA, identify differentially methylated regions between sample groups, and uncover the presence of megabase-size placenta hypomethylated domains.},

abstract = {The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium was set up to analyze brain measures and genotypes from multiple sites across the world to improve the power to detect genetic variants that influence the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common genetic variants may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. DTI measures, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying genetic variants that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI working group, we analyzed high-resolution FA images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18-85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized FA image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived FA measures. We show that our template is reliable for integrating multiple datasets by combining results through meta-analysis and unifying the data through exploratory mega-analyses. Our results may help prioritize regions of the FA map that are consistently influenced by additive genetic factors for future genetic discovery studies. Protocols and templates are publicly available at (http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-working-group/).},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are revolutionizing the search for the genes underlying human complex diseases. The main decisions to be made at the design stage of these studies are the choice of the commercial genotyping chip to be used and the numbers of case and control samples to be genotyped. The most common method of comparing different chips is using a measure of coverage, but this fails to properly account for the effects of sample size, the genetic model of the disease, and linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. In this paper, we argue that the statistical power to detect a causative variant should be the major criterion in study design. Because of the complicated pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, power cannot be calculated analytically and must instead be assessed by simulation. We describe in detail a method of simulating case-control samples at a set of linked SNPs that replicates the patterns of LD in human populations, and we used it to assess power for a comprehensive set of available genotyping chips. Our results allow us to compare the performance of the chips to detect variants with different effect sizes and allele frequencies, look at how power changes with sample size in different populations or when using multi-marker tags and genotype imputation approaches, and how performance compares to a hypothetical chip that contains every SNP in HapMap. A main conclusion of this study is that marked differences in genome coverage may not translate into appreciable differences in power and that, when taking budgetary considerations into account, the most powerful design may not always correspond to the chip with the highest coverage. We also show that genotype imputation can be used to boost the power of many chips up to the level obtained from a hypothetical "complete" chip containing all the SNPs in HapMap. Our results have been encapsulated into an R software package that allows users to design future association studies and our methods provide a framework with which new chip sets can be evaluated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In designing genome-wide association (GWA) studies it is important to calculate statistical power. General statistical power calculation procedures for quantitative measures often require information concerning summary statistics of distributions such as mean and variance. However, with genetic studies, the effect size of quantitative traits is traditionally expressed as heritability, a quantity defined as the amount of phenotypic variation in the population that can be ascribed to the genetic variants among individuals. Heritability is hard to transform into summary statistics. Therefore, general power calculation procedures cannot be used directly in GWA studies. The development of appropriate statistical methods and a user-friendly software package to address this problem would be welcomed.

RESULTS: This paper presents GWAPower, a statistical software package of power calculation designed for GWA studies with quantitative traits, where genetic effect is defined as heritability. Based on several popular one-degree-of-freedom genetic models, this method avoids the need to specify the non-centrality parameter of the F-distribution under the alternative hypothesis. Therefore, it can use heritability information directly without approximation. In GWAPower, the power calculation can be easily adjusted for adding covariates and linkage disequilibrium information. An example is provided to illustrate GWAPower, followed by discussions.

CONCLUSIONS: GWAPower is a user-friendly free software package for calculating statistical power based on heritability in GWA studies with quantitative traits. The software is freely available at: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10502931/GWAPower.zip.},

abstract = {We have recently developed analysis methods (GREML) to estimate the genetic variance of a complex trait/disease and the genetic correlation between two complex traits/diseases using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in unrelated individuals. Here we use analytical derivations and simulations to quantify the sampling variance of the estimate of the proportion of phenotypic variance captured by all SNPs for quantitative traits and case-control studies. We also derive the approximate sampling variance of the estimate of a genetic correlation in a bivariate analysis, when two complex traits are either measured on the same or different individuals. We show that the sampling variance is inversely proportional to the number of pairwise contrasts in the analysis and to the variance in SNP-derived genetic relationships. For bivariate analysis, the sampling variance of the genetic correlation additionally depends on the harmonic mean of the proportion of variance explained by the SNPs for the two traits and the genetic correlation between the traits, and depends on the phenotypic correlation when the traits are measured on the same individuals. We provide an online tool for calculating the power of detecting genetic (co)variation using genome-wide SNP data. The new theory and online tool will be helpful to plan experimental designs to estimate the missing heritability that has not yet been fully revealed through genome-wide association studies, and to estimate the genetic overlap between complex traits (diseases) in particular when the traits (diseases) are not measured on the same samples.},

abstract = {The structure of the human brain is highly heritable, and is thought to be influenced by many common genetic variants, many of which are currently unknown. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age+/-s.d.: 75.52+/-6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover genetic influences on brain structure.},

Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 516,645 unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the analysis following quality control measures. The genotype data and raw genetic data are freely available for download (LONI, http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/). Two analyses were completed: a standard case-control analysis, and a novel approach using hippocampal atrophy measured on MRI as an objectively defined, quantitative phenotype. A General Linear Model was applied to identify SNPs for which there was an interaction between the genotype and diagnosis on the quantitative trait. The case-control analysis identified APOE and a new risk gene, TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), at a genome-wide significance level of {\textless} or =10(-6) (10(-11) for a haplotype). TOMM40 risk alleles were approximately twice as frequent in AD subjects as controls. The quantitative trait analysis identified 21 genes or chromosomal areas with at least one SNP with a p-value {\textless} or =10(-6), which can be considered potential "new" candidate loci to explore in the etiology of sporadic AD. These candidates included EFNA5, CAND1, MAGI2, ARSB, and PRUNE2, genes involved in the regulation of protein degradation, apoptosis, neuronal loss and neurodevelopment. Thus, we identified common genetic variants associated with the increased risk of developing AD in the ADNI cohort, and present publicly available genome-wide data. Supportive evidence based on case-control studies and biological plausibility by gene annotation is provided. Currently no available sample with both imaging and genetic data is available for replication.

CONCLUSIONS: Using hippocampal atrophy as a quantitative phenotype in a genome-wide scan, we have identified candidate risk genes for sporadic Alzheimer's disease that merit further investigation.},

abstract = {Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10(-7)).},

abstract = {Multi-trait mixed models have emerged as a promising approach for joint analyses of multiple traits. In principle, the mixed model framework is remarkably general. However, current methods implement only a very specific range of tasks to optimize the necessary computations. Here, we present a multi-trait modeling framework that is versatile and fast: LIMIX enables to flexibly adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study designs. To highlight the novel modeling aspects of LIMIX we performed three vastly different genetic studies: joint GWAS of correlated blood lipid phenotypes, joint analysis of the expression levels of the multiple transcript-isoforms of a gene, and pathway-based modeling of molecular traits across environments. In these applications we show that LIMIX increases GWAS power and phenotype prediction accuracy, in particular when integrating stepwise multi-locus regression into multi-trait models, and when analyzing large numbers of traits. An open source implementation of LIMIX is freely available at: https://github.com/PMBio/limix.},

abstract = {A sample size with sufficient statistical power is critical to the success of genetic association studies to detect causal genes of human complex diseases. Genome-wide association studies require much larger sample sizes to achieve an adequate statistical power. We estimated the statistical power with increasing numbers of markers analyzed and compared the sample sizes that were required in case-control studies and case-parent studies. We computed the effective sample size and statistical power using Genetic Power Calculator. An analysis using a larger number of markers requires a larger sample size. Testing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker requires 248 cases, while testing 500,000 SNPs and 1 million markers requires 1,206 cases and 1,255 cases, respectively, under the assumption of an odds ratio of 2, 5{\%} disease prevalence, 5{\%} minor allele frequency, complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), 1:1 case/control ratio, and a 5{\%} error rate in an allelic test. Under a dominant model, a smaller sample size is required to achieve 80{\%} power than other genetic models. We found that a much lower sample size was required with a strong effect size, common SNP, and increased LD. In addition, studying a common disease in a case-control study of a 1:4 case-control ratio is one way to achieve higher statistical power. We also found that case-parent studies require more samples than case-control studies. Although we have not covered all plausible cases in study design, the estimates of sample size and statistical power computed under various assumptions in this study may be useful to determine the sample size in designing a population-based genetic association study.},

abstract = {The authors investigated 3 important areas related to the clinical use of left ventricular mass (LVM): accuracy of assessments by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), the ability to predict cardiovascular outcomes, and the comparative value of different indexing methods. The recommended formula for echocardiographic estimation of LVM uses linear measurements and is based on the assumption of the left ventricle (LV) as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. CMR permits a modeling of the LV free of cardiac geometric assumptions or acoustic window dependency, showing better accuracy and reproducibility. However, echocardiography has lower cost, easier availability, and better tolerability. From the MEDLINE database, 26 longitudinal echocardiographic studies and 5 CMR studies investigating LVM or LV hypertrophy as predictors of death or major cardiovascular outcomes were identified. LVM and LV hypertrophy were reliable cardiovascular risk predictors using both modalities. However, no study directly compared the methods for the ability to predict events, agreement in hypertrophy classification, or performance in cardiovascular risk reclassification. Indexing LVM to body surface area was the earliest normalization process used, but it seems to underestimate the prevalence of hypertrophy in obese and overweight subjects. Dividing LVM by height to the allometric power of 1.7 or 2.7 is the most promising normalization method in terms of practicality and usefulness from a clinical and scientific standpoint for scaling myocardial mass to body size. The measurement of LVM, calculation of LVM index, and classification for LV hypertrophy should be standardized by scientific societies across measurement techniques and adopted by clinicians in risk stratification and therapeutic decision making.},

Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24{\%}) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},

abstract = {Gene discovery, estimation of heritability captured by SNP arrays, inference on genetic architecture and prediction analyses of complex traits are usually performed using different statistical models and methods, leading to inefficiency and loss of power. Here we use a Bayesian mixture model that simultaneously allows variant discovery, estimation of genetic variance explained by all variants and prediction of unobserved phenotypes in new samples. We apply the method to simulated data of quantitative traits and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data on disease and show that it provides accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, produces unbiased estimators of risk in new samples, and that it can estimate genetic architecture by partitioning variation across hundreds to thousands of SNPs. We estimated that, depending on the trait, 2,633 to 9,411 SNPs explain all of the SNP-based heritability in the WTCCC diseases. The majority of those SNPs ({\textgreater}96{\%}) had small effects, confirming a substantial polygenic component to common diseases. The proportion of the SNP-based variance explained by large effects (each SNP explaining 1{\%} of the variance) varied markedly between diseases, ranging from almost zero for bipolar disorder to 72{\%} for type 1 diabetes. Prediction analyses demonstrate that for diseases with major loci, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Bayesian methods outperform profile scoring or mixed model approaches.},

abstract = {The standard analysis approach in neuroimaging genetics studies is the mass-univariate linear modeling (MULM) approach. From a statistical view, however, this approach is disadvantageous, as it is computationally intensive, cannot account for complex multivariate relationships, and has to be corrected for multiple testing. In contrast, multivariate methods offer the opportunity to include combined information from multiple variants to discover meaningful associations between genetic and brain imaging data. We assessed three multivariate techniques, partial least squares correlation (PLSC), sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse CCA) and Bayesian inter-battery factor analysis (Bayesian IBFA), with respect to their ability to detect multivariate genotype-phenotype associations. Our goal was to systematically compare these three approaches with respect to their performance and to assess their suitability for high-dimensional and multi-collinearly dependent data as is the case in neuroimaging genetics studies. In a series of simulations using both linearly independent and multi-collinear data, we show that sparse CCA and PLSC are suitable even for very high-dimensional collinear imaging data sets. Among those two, the predictive power was higher for sparse CCA when voxel numbers were below 400 times sample size and candidate SNPs were considered. Accordingly, we recommend Sparse CCA for candidate phenotype, candidate SNP studies. When voxel numbers exceeded 500 times sample size, the predictive power was the highest for PLSC. Therefore, PLSC can be considered a promising technique for multivariate modeling of high-dimensional brain-SNP-associations. In contrast, Bayesian IBFA cannot be recommended, since additional post-processing steps were necessary to detect causal relations. To verify the applicability of sparse CCA and PLSC, we applied them to an experimental imaging genetics data set provided for us. Most importantly, application of both methods replicated the findings of this data set.},

There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

@article{Martins2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: TP53 and BRCA1/2 mutations are the main drivers in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). We hypothesise that combining tissue phenotypes from image analysis of tumour sections with genomic profiles could reveal other significant driver events.

RESULTS: Automatic estimates of stromal content combined with genomic analysis of TCGA HGSOC tumours show that stroma strongly biases estimates of PTEN expression. Tumour-specific PTEN expression was tested in two independent cohorts using tissue microarrays containing 521 cases of HGSOC. PTEN loss or downregulation occurred in 77{\%} of the first cohort by immunofluorescence and 52{\%} of the validation group by immunohistochemistry, and is associated with worse survival in a multivariate Cox-regression model adjusted for study site, age, stage and grade. Reanalysis of TCGA data shows that hemizygous loss of PTEN is common (36{\%}) and expression of PTEN and expression of androgen receptor are positively associated. Low androgen receptor expression was associated with reduced survival in data from TCGA and immunohistochemical analysis of the first cohort.

CONCLUSION: PTEN loss is a common event in HGSOC and defines a subgroup with significantly worse prognosis, suggesting the rational use of drugs to target PI3K and androgen receptor pathways for HGSOC. This work shows that integrative approaches combining tissue phenotypes from images with genomic analysis can resolve confounding effects of tissue heterogeneity and should be used to identify new drivers in other cancers.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

Because of the explosive growth of methods for assessing genetic variation at a fine scale, evolutionary biologists and human geneticists are increasingly exploiting linkage disequilibrium in order to understand past evolutionary and demographic events, to map genes that are associated with quantitative characters and inherited diseases, and to understand the joint evolution of linked sets of genes. This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

We discuss: 1) the morphogenesis and anatomical arrangement of muscle fibers in the adult LV; 2) the sequence of depolarization and repolarization; 3) the physiological inhomogeneity of transmural myocardial mechanics and the apex-to-base sequence of longitudinal and circumferential deformation; 4) the sequence of LV rotation; and 5) the link between LV deformation and the intracavitary flow direction observed during each phase of the cardiac cycle. Integrating the LV structure with electrical activation and motion sequences observed in vivo provides an understanding about the spatiotemporal sequence of regional myocardial performance that is essential for noninvasive cardiac imaging. {\textcopyright} 2006 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

Despite these successes, the variants identified by these studies have generally explained only a small fraction of the heritable component of disease risk, and have not pinpointed with certainty the causal variant(s) at the associated loci. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action by which associated loci influence disease or quantitative phenotypes are often unclear, because we do not know through which gene(s) the associated variants exert their effects or because these gene(s) are of unknown function or have no clear connection to known disease biology. Thus, the initial set of genome-wide association studies serve as a starting point for future genetic and functional studies.

A number of such calling algorithms have been recently established for the Affymetrix GeneChip genotyping technology. Here, we present a fast and accurate genotype calling algorithm for the Illumina BeadArray genotyping platforms. As the technology moves towards assaying millions of genetic polymorphisms simultaneously, there is a need for an integrated and easy-to-use software for calling genotypes. RESULTS: We have introduced a model-based genotype calling algorithm which does not rely on having prior training data or require computationally intensive procedures. The algorithm can assign genotypes to hybridization data from thousands of individuals simultaneously and pools information across multiple individuals to improve the calling. The method can accommodate variations in hybridization intensities which result in dramatic shifts of the position of the genotype clouds by identifying the optimal coordinates to initialize the algorithm. By incorporating the process of perturbation analysis, we can obtain a quality metric measuring the stability of the assigned genotype calls. We show that this quality metric can be used to identify SNPs with low call rates and accuracy.

@article{Pournara2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most existing algorithms for the inference of the structure of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data assume that the activity levels of transcription factors (TFs) are proportional to their mRNA levels. This assumption is invalid for most biological systems. However, one might be able to reconstruct unobserved activity profiles of TFs from the expression profiles of target genes. A simple model is a two-layer network with unobserved TF variables in the first layer and observed gene expression variables in the second layer. TFs are connected to regulated genes by weighted edges. The weights, known as factor loadings, indicate the strength and direction of regulation. Of particular interest are methods that produce sparse networks, networks with few edges, since it is known that most genes are regulated by only a small number of TFs, and most TFs regulate only a small number of genes. RESULTS: In this paper, we explore the performance of five factor analysis algorithms, Bayesian as well as classical, on problems with biological context using both simulated and real data. Factor analysis (FA) models are used in order to describe a larger number of observed variables by a smaller number of unobserved variables, the factors, whereby all correlation between observed variables is explained by common factors. Bayesian FA methods allow one to infer sparse networks by enforcing sparsity through priors. In contrast, in the classical FA, matrix rotation methods are used to enforce sparsity and thus to increase the interpretability of the inferred factor loadings matrix. However, we also show that Bayesian FA models that do not impose sparsity through the priors can still be used for the reconstruction of a gene regulatory network if applied in conjunction with matrix rotation methods. Finally, we show the added advantage of merging the information derived from all algorithms in order to obtain a combined result. CONCLUSION: Most of the algorithms tested are successful in reconstructing the connectivity structure as well as the TF profiles. Moreover, we demonstrate that if the underlying network is sparse it is still possible to reconstruct hidden activity profiles of TFs to some degree without prior connectivity information.},

Parametric t-SNE learns the parametric mapping in such a way that the local structure of the data is preserved as well as possible in the latent space. We evaluate the performance of parametric t-SNE in experiments on two datasets, in which we compare it to the performance of two other unsupervised parametric dimensionality reduction techniques. The results of experiments illustrate the strong performance of parametric t-SNE, in particular, in learning settings in which the dimensionality of the latent space is relatively low.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptional regulation is an important part of regulatory control in eukaryotes. Even if binding motifs for transcription factors are known, the task of finding binding sites by scanning sequences is plagued by false positives. One way to improve the detection of binding sites from motifs is by taking cooperativity of transcription factor binding into account. We propose a non-parametric probabilistic model, similar to a document topic model, for detecting transcriptional programs, groups of cooperative transcription factors and co-regulated genes. The analysis results in transcriptional programs which generalise both transcriptional modules and TF-target gene incidence matrices and provide a higher-level summary of these structures. The method is independent of prior specification of training sets of genes, for example, via gene expression data. The analysis is based on known binding motifs. RESULTS: We applied our method to putative regulatory regions of 18,445 Mus musculus genes. We discovered just 68 transcriptional programs that effectively summarised the action of 149 transcription factors on these genes. Several of these programs were significantly enriched for known biological processes and signalling pathways. One transcriptional program has a significant overlap with a reference set of cell cycle specific transcription factors. CONCLUSION: Our method is able to pick out higher order structure from noisy sequence analyses. The transcriptional programs it identifies potentially represent common mechanisms of regulatory control across the genome. It simultaneously predicts which genes are co-regulated and which sets of transcription factors cooperate to achieve this co-regulation. The programs we discovered enable biologists to choose new genes and transcription factors to study in specific transcriptional regulatory systems.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the cardiovascular system has evolved through the years by extensive studies emphasizing the identification of the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in its normal function and disease pathogenesis. Major discoveries have been made along the way. However, the majority of this work has focused on specific genes or pathways rather than integrative approaches. In cardiomyopathies alone, over 30 different loci have shown mutations with varying inheritance patterns, yet mostly coding for structural proteins. The emergence of microarrays in the early 1990s paved the way to a new era of cardiovascular research. Microarrays dramatically accelerated the rhythm of discoveries by giving us the ability to simultaneously study thousands of genes in a single experiment. In the field of cardiovascular research, microarrays are having a significant contribution, with the majority of work focusing on end-stage cardiomyopathies that lead to heart failure. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, known pathways are seen under new light, disease subgroups begin to emerge, and the effects of various drugs are molecularly dissected. This cross-study data comparison concludes that consistent energy metabolism gene expression changes occur across dilated, hypertrophic, and ischemic cardiomyopathies, while Ca2+ homeostasis changes are prominent in the first two cardiomyopathies, and structural gene expression changes accompany mostly the dilated form. Gene expression changes are further correlated to disease genetics. The future of microarrays in the cardiomyopathy field is discussed with an emphasis on optimum experimental design and on applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug discovery.},

The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. Shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Moreover, the shape context leads to a robust score for measuring shape similarity, once shapes are aligned. The shape context descriptor is tolerant to all common shape deformations. As a key advantage no special landmarks or key-points are necessary. It is thus a generic method with applications in object recognition, image registration and point set matching. Using examples involving both handwritten digits and 3D objects, we illustrate its power for object recognition.},

This article focuses on discussion of the conditional frequentist approach to testing, which is argued to provide the basis for a methodological unification of the approaches of Fisher, Jeffreys and Neyman. The idea is to follow Fisher in using p-values to define the "strength of evidence" in data and to follow his approach of conditioning on strength of evidence; then follow Neyman by computing Type I and Type II error probabilities, but do so conditional on the strength of evidence in the data. The resulting conditional frequentist error probabilities equal the objective posterior probabilities of the hypotheses advocated by Jeffrey},

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

It has$\backslash$rbeen developed with an aim to reduce or eliminate information bearing secondary importance, and$\backslash$rretain or highlight meaningful information while reducing the dimensionality of data.$\backslash$rSince the nature of real-world data is often nonlinear, linear dimensionality reduction techniques,$\backslash$rsuch as principal component analysis (PCA), fail to preserve a structure and relationships in a$\backslash$rhighdimensional space when data are mapped into a low-dimensional space. This means that$\backslash$rnonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are in demand in this case. Among them is a method$\backslash$rcalled locally linear embedding (LLE), which is the focus of this thesis. Its main attractive$\backslash$rcharacteristics are few free parameters to be set and a non-iterative solution avoiding the convergence$\backslash$rto a local minimum. In this thesis, several extensions to the conventional LLE are proposed, which$\backslash$raid us to overcome some limitations of the algorithm.

abstract = {The switch to a modern lifestyle in recent decades has coincided with a rapid increase in prevalence of obesity and other diseases. These shifts in prevalence could be explained by the release of genetic susceptibility for disease in the form of gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Yet, the detection of interaction effects requires large sample sizes, little replication has been reported, and a few studies have demonstrated environmental effects only after summing the risk of GWAS alleles into genetic risk scores (GRSxE). We performed extensive simulations of a quantitative trait controlled by 2500 causal variants to inspect the feasibility to detect gene-by-environment interactions in the context of GWAS. The simulated individuals were assigned either to an ancestral or a modern setting that alters the phenotype by increasing the effect size by 1.05-2-fold at a varying fraction of perturbed SNPs (from 1 to 20{\%}). We report two main results. First, for a wide range of realistic scenarios, highly significant GRSxE is detected despite the absence of individual genotype GxE evidence at the contributing loci. Second, an increase in phenotypic variance after environmental perturbation reduces the power to discover susceptibility variants by GWAS in mixed cohorts with individuals from both ancestral and modern environments. We conclude that a pervasive presence of gene-by-environment effects can remain hidden even though it contributes to the genetic architecture of complex traits.},

abstract = {Exome sequencing studies in complex diseases are challenged by the allelic heterogeneity, large number and modest effect sizes of associated variants on disease risk and the presence of large numbers of neutral variants, even in phenotypically relevant genes. Isolated populations with recent bottlenecks offer advantages for studying rare variants in complex diseases as they have deleterious variants that are present at higher frequencies as well as a substantial reduction in rare neutral variation. To explore the potential of the Finnish founder population for studying low-frequency (0.5-5{\%}) variants in complex diseases, we compared exome sequence data on 3,000 Finns to the same number of non-Finnish Europeans and discovered that, despite having fewer variable sites overall, the average Finn has more low-frequency loss-of-function variants and complete gene knockouts. We then used several well-characterized Finnish population cohorts to study the phenotypic effects of 83 enriched loss-of-function variants across 60 phenotypes in 36,262 Finns. Using a deep set of quantitative traits collected on these cohorts, we show 5 associations (p{\textless}5×10-8) including splice variants in LPA that lowered plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P = 1.5×10-117). Through accessing the national medical records of these participants, we evaluate the LPA finding via Mendelian randomization and confirm that these splice variants confer protection from cardiovascular disease (OR = 0.84, P = 3×10-4), demonstrating for the first time the correlation between very low levels of LPA in humans with potential therapeutic implications for cardiovascular diseases. More generally, this study articulates substantial advantages for studying the role of rare variation in complex phenotypes in founder populations like the Finns and by combining a unique population genetic history with data from large population cohorts and centralized research access to National Health Registers.},

We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in four prospective studies from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and demonstrated that sequence variants near the NINJ2 gene are associated with incident ischemic stroke. Here, we sought to fine-map functional variants in the region and evaluate the contribution of rare variants to ischemic stroke risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced 196 kb around NINJ2 on chromosome 12p13 among 3,986 European ancestry participants, including 475 ischemic stroke cases, from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and Framingham Heart Study. Meta-analyses of single-variant tests for 425 common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≥ 1{\%}) confirmed the original GWAS results and identified an independent intronic variant, rs34166160 (MAF = 0.012), most significantly associated with incident ischemic stroke (HR = 1.80, p = 0.0003). Aggregating 278 putatively-functional variants with MAF≤ 1{\%} using count statistics, we observed a nominally statistically significant association, with the burden of rare NINJ2 variants contributing to decreased ischemic stroke incidence (HR = 0.81; p = 0.026).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Common and rare variants in the NINJ2 region were nominally associated with incident ischemic stroke among a subset of CHARGE participants. Allelic heterogeneity at this locus, caused by multiple rare, low frequency, and common variants with disparate effects on risk, may explain the difficulties in replicating the original GWAS results. Additional studies that take into account the complex allelic architecture at this locus are needed to confirm these findings.},

Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

abstract = {The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is ∼25{\%}. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (≥85 years) and 16 121 younger controls ({\textless}65 years) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged ≥90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity, as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years, at a novel locus, rs2149954, on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR = 1.10, P = 1.74 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome 19q13.32 (OR = 0.72, P = 3.40 × 10(-36)), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n = 34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using genome-wide genetic, gene expression, and microRNA expression (miRNA) data, we developed an integrative approach to investigate the genetic and epigenetic basis of chemotherapeutic sensitivity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Through a sequential multi-stage framework, we identified genes and miRNAs whose expression correlated with platinum sensitivity, mapped these to genomic loci as quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and evaluated the associations between these QTLs and platinum sensitivity. A permutation analysis showed that top findings from our approach have a much lower false discovery rate compared to those from a traditional GWAS of drug sensitivity. Our approach identified five SNPs associated with 10 miRNAs and the expression level of 15 genes, all of which were associated with carboplatin sensitivity. Of particular interest was one SNP (rs11138019), which was associated with the expression of both miR-30d and the gene ABCD2, which were themselves correlated with both carboplatin and cisplatin drug-specific phenotype in the HapMap samples. Functional study found that knocking down ABCD2 in vitro led to increased apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 after cisplatin treatment. Over-expression of miR-30d in vitro caused a decrease in ABCD2 expression, suggesting a functional relationship between the two.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We developed an integrative approach to the investigation of the genetic and epigenetic basis of human complex traits. Our approach outperformed standard GWAS and provided hints at potential biological function. The relationships between ABCD2 and miR-30d, and ABCD2 and platin sensitivity were experimentally validated, suggesting a functional role of ABCD2 and miR-30d in sensitivity to platinating agents.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are useful for nominating candidate genes, but typically are unable to establish disease causality or differentiate between the effects of variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Additionally, some GWAS loci might contain multiple causative variants or genes that contribute to the overall disease susceptibility at a single locus. However, the majority of current GWAS lack the statistical power to test whether multiple causative genes underlie the same locus, prompting us to adopt an alternative approach to testing multiple GWAS genes empirically. We used gene targeting in a disease-susceptible rat model of genetic hypertension to test all six genes at the Agtrap-Plod1 locus (Agtrap, Mthfr, Clcn6, Nppa, Nppb, and Plod1) for blood pressure (BP) and renal phenotypes. This revealed that the majority of genes at this locus (five out of six) can impact hypertension by modifying BP and renal phenotypes. Mutations of Nppa, Plod1, and Mthfr increased disease susceptibility, whereas Agtrap and Clcn6 mutations decreased hypertension risk. Reanalysis of the human AGTRAP-PLOD1 locus also implied that disease-associated haplotype blocks with polygenic effects were not only possible, but rather were highly plausible. Combined, these data demonstrate for the first time that multiple modifiers of hypertension can cosegregate at a single GWAS locus.},

@article{Preeprem2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personal genome analysis is now being considered for evaluation of disease risk in healthy individuals, utilizing both rare and common variants. Multiple scores have been developed to predict the deleteriousness of amino acid substitutions, using information on the allele frequencies, level of evolutionary conservation, and averaged structural evidence. However, agreement among these scores is limited and they likely over-estimate the fraction of the genome that is deleterious. METHOD: This study proposes an integrative approach to identify a subset of homozygous non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). An 8-level classification scheme is constructed from the presence/absence of deleterious predictions combined with evidence of association with disease or complex traits. Detailed literature searches and structural validations are then performed for a subset of homozygous 826 mis-sense mutations in 575 proteins found in the genomes of 12 healthy adults. RESULTS: Implementation of the Association-Adjusted Consensus Deleterious Scheme (AACDS) classifies 11{\%} of all predicted highly deleterious homozygous variants as most likely to influence disease risk. The number of such variants per genome ranges from 0 to 8 with no significant difference between African and Caucasian Americans. Detailed analysis of mutations affecting the APOE, MTMR2, THSB1, CHIA, alphaMyHC, and AMY2A proteins shows how the protein structure is likely to be disrupted, even though the associated phenotypes have not been documented in the corresponding individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The classification system for homozygous nsSNPs provides an opportunity to systematically rank nsSNPs based on suggestive evidence from annotations and sequence-based predictions. The ranking scheme, in-depth literature searches, and structural validations of highly prioritized mis-sense mutations compliment traditional sequence-based approaches and should have particular utility for the development of individualized health profiles. An online tool reporting the AACDS score for any variant is provided at the authors' website.},

abstract = {Summary The clinical course and eventual outcome, or prognosis, of complex diseases varies enormously between affected individuals. This variability critically determines the impact a disease has on a patient's life but is very poorly understood. Here, we exploit existing genome-wide association study data to gain insight into the role of genetics in prognosis. We identify a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A (rs12212067: T {\textgreater} G) at which the minor (G) allele, despite not being associated with disease susceptibility, is associated with a milder course of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis and with increased risk of severe malaria. Minor allele carriage is shown to limit inflammatory responses in monocytes via a FOXO3-driven pathway, which through TGF$\beta$1 reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF$\alpha$, and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10. Thus, we uncover a shared genetic contribution to prognosis in distinct diseases that operates via a FOXO3-driven pathway modulating inflammatory responses.

abstract = {In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors - a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

abstract = {This book is an introduction to manifolds at the beginning graduate level. It contains the essential topological ideas that are needed for the further study of manifolds, particularly in the context of differential geometry, algebraic topology, and related fields. Its guiding philosophy is to develop these ideas rigorously but economically, with minimal prerequisites and plenty of geometric intuition. A course on manifolds differs from most other introductory mathematics graduate courses in that the subject matter is often completely unfamiliar. Unlike algebra and analysis, which all math majors see as undergraduates, manifolds enter the curriculum much later. It is even possible to get through an entire undergraduate mathematics education without ever hearing the word "manifold." Yet manifolds are part of the basic vocabulary of modern mathematics, and students need to know them as intimately as they know the integers, the real numbers, Euclidean spaces, groups, rings, and fields. In his beautifully-conceived Introduction, the author motivates the technical developments to follow by explaining some of the roles manifolds play in diverse branches of mathematics and physics. Then he goes on to introduce the basics of general topology and continues with the fundamental group, covering spaces, and elementary homology theory. Manifolds are introduced early and used as the main examples throughout. John M. Lee is currently Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle. In addition to pursuing research in differential geometry and partial differential equations, he has been teaching undergraduate and graduate courses on manifolds at U.W. and Harvard University for more than fifteen years.},

The association was replicated in 3,202 cases and 40,062 controls for an overall meta-analysis P value of 1.69 × 10⁻¹¹ (odds ratio = 1.18, 95{\%} CI 1.127-1.244). rs1835740 is located between MTDH (astrocyte elevated gene 1, also known as AEG-1) and PGCP (encoding plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase). In an expression quantitative trait study in lymphoblastoid cell lines, transcript levels of the MTDH were found to have a significant correlation to rs1835740 (P = 3.96 × 10⁻⁵, permuted threshold for genome-wide significance 7.7 × 10⁻⁵. To our knowledge, our data establish rs1835740 as the first genetic risk factor for migraine.},

In a population-based genome-wide analysis including 5,122 migraineurs and 18,108 non-migraineurs, rs2651899 (1p36.32, PRDM16), rs10166942 (2q37.1, TRPM8) and rs11172113 (12q13.3, LRP1) were among the top seven associations (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-6)) with migraine. These SNPs were significant in a meta-analysis among three replication cohorts and met genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis combining the discovery and replication cohorts (rs2651899, odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 3.8 × 10(-9); rs10166942, OR = 0.85, P = 5.5 × 10(-12); and rs11172113, OR = 0.90, P = 4.3 × 10(-9)). The associations at rs2651899 and rs10166942 were specific for migraine compared with non-migraine headache. None of the three SNP associations was preferential for migraine with aura or without aura, nor were any associations specific for migraine features. TRPM8 has been the focus of neuropathic pain models, whereas LRP1 modulates neuronal glutamate signaling, plausibly linking both genes to migraine pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},

We extensively characterize the resulting in vivo blueprint of metabolism in human blood by integrating it with information on gene expression, heritability and overlap with known loci for complex disorders, inborn errors of metabolism and pharmacological targets. We further developed a database and web-based resources for data mining and results visualization. Our findings provide new insights into the role of inherited variation in blood metabolic diversity and identify potential new opportunities for drug development and for understanding disease.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P {\textless} 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10{\%} of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16{\%} of phenotypic variation (approximately 20{\%} of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P {\textless} 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10{\%} of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16{\%} of phenotypic variation (approximately 20{\%} of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

abstract = {Mild facial asymmetries are common in typical growth patterns. Therefore, detection of disordered facial growth patterns in individuals characterized by asymmetries is preferably accomplished by reference to the typical variation found in the general population rather than to some ideal of perfect symmetry, which rarely exists. This presents a challenge in developing an asymmetry assessment tool that is applicable, without modification, to detect both mild and severe facial asymmetries. In this paper we use concepts from geometric morphometrics to obtain robust and spatially-dense asymmetry assessments using a superimposition protocol for comparison of a face with its mirror image. Spatially-dense localization of asymmetries was achieved using an anthropometric mask consisting of uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks that were automatically indicated on 3D facial images. Robustness, in the sense of an unbiased analysis under increasing asymmetry, was ensured by an adaptive, robust, least-squares superimposition. The degree of overall asymmetry in an individual was scored using a root-mean-squared-error, and the proportion was scored using a novel relative significant asymmetry percentage. This protocol was applied to a database of 3D facial images from 359 young healthy individuals and three individuals with disordered facial growth. Typical asymmetry statistics were derived and were mainly located on, but not limited to, the lower two-thirds of the face in males and females. The asymmetry in males was more extensive and of a greater magnitude than in females. This protocol and proposed scoring of asymmetry with accompanying reference statistics will be useful for the detection and quantification of facial asymmetry in future studies.},

In this paper, we systematically analyze the properties of AE read count data and technical sources of error, such as low-quality or double-counted RNA-seq reads, genotyping errors, allelic mapping bias, and technical covariates due to sample preparation and sequencing, and variation in total read depth. We provide guidelines for correcting and filtering for such errors, and show that the resulting AE data has extremely low technical noise. Finally, we introduce novel software for high-throughput production of AE data from RNA-sequencing data, implemented in the GATK framework. These improved tools and best practices for AE analysis yield higher quality AE data by reducing technical bias. This provides a practical framework for wider adoption of AE analysis by the genomics community.},

abstract = {Keng Po Lai and Jing-Woei Li contributed equally to this work. BACKGROUND:The marine medaka Oryzias melastigma has been demonstrated as a novel model for marine ecotoxicological studies. However, the lack of genome and transcriptome reference has largely restricted the use of O. melastigma in the assessment of in vivo molecular responses to environmental stresses and the analysis of biological toxicity in the marine environment. Although O. melastigma is believed to be phylogenetically closely related to Oryzias latipes, the divergence between these two species is still largely unknown. Using Illumina high-throughput RNA sequencing followed by de novo assembly and comprehensive gene annotation, we provided transcriptomic resources for the brain, liver, ovary and testis of O. melastigma. We also investigated the possible extent of divergence between O. melastigma and O. latipes at the transcriptome level.RESULTS:More than 14,000 transcripts across brain, liver, ovary and testis in marine medaka were annotated, of which 5880 transcripts were orthologous between O. melastigma and O. latipes. Tissue-enriched genes were identified in O. melastigma, and Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated the functional specificity of the annotated genes in respective tissue. Lastly, the identification of marine medaka-enriched transcripts suggested the necessity of generating transcriptome dataset of O. melastigma.CONCLUSIONS:Orthologous transcripts between O. melastigma and O. latipes, tissue-enriched genes and O. melastigma-enriched transcripts were identified. Genome-wide expression studies of marine medaka require an assembled transcriptome, and this sequencing effort has generated a valuable resource of coding DNA for a non-model species. This transcriptome resource will aid future studies assessing in vivo molecular responses to environmental stresses and those analyzing biological toxicity in the marine environment.},

These loci, which can be identified from sufficiently powerful GWASs, together could explain at least 15-20{\%} of the known heritability of these traits. However, for BPC cancers, which have modest familial aggregation, our analysis suggests that risk models based on common variants alone will have modest discriminatory power (63.5{\%} area under curve), even with new discoveries.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many traits and diseases. However, at existing sample sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated heritability. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes may improve detection without the need for larger datasets. The Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds. Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and has several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis. However, existing methods require distinct control samples between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability. Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs. We apply our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls, enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease associations across five diseases not previously declared. Our technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and establishes robust limits on the expected FDR. This approach can improve SNP detection in GWAS, and give insight into shared aetiology between phenotypically related conditions.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have seen unprecedented success in identifying genetic loci that correlate with disease susceptibility and severity. Early phases of these studies have predominantly been performed in the Caucasian populations. The next phase in medical genetics is to extend the exploration across genetically diverse populations to leverage on larger sample sizes for locating smaller effects that may be present in most human populations. However, discoveries from these studies do not actually reveal the underlying functional changes to the human genome, but only point to broad regions stipulated by the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Fine-mapping the functional variants can, however, be hampered by extensive LD, which can yield multiple perfect surrogates that are not distinguishable from the underlying causal variants, although several studies have illustrated the value of relying on multiple genetically diverse populations to narrow the candidate regions where the functional variants can be found in. Here, we explore the efficiency of trans-ethnic meta-analysis in discovering genetic association and in fine-mapping the causal variants by asking: are there any population diversity metrics that will be useful for: (i) identifying the populations or genomic regions where meta-analysis are likely to be more successful for discovering associations?; (ii) identifying the populations or loci to perform deep targeted sequencing for the purpose of fine-mapping causal variants? Our results indicate that simple metrics like the F(ST) or the population specificity of haplotypes are useful in trans-ethnic meta-analyses, while the degree of haplotype sharing and LD variation are informative of the efficiency in trans-ethnic fine-mapping.},

Sequential conditional analyses revealed that ten, nine, and four loci in African Americans, Europeans, and East Asians, respectively, exhibited two or more signals. At these loci, accounting for all signals led to a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in the explained phenotypic variance compared to the strongest signals. Distinct signals across ancestry groups were identified at PCSK9 and APOA5. Trans-ethnic analyses narrowed the signals to smaller sets of variants at GCKR, PPP1R3B, ABO, LCAT, and ABCA1. Of 27 variants reported previously to have functional effects, 74{\%} exhibited the strongest association at the respective signal. In conclusion, trans-ethnic high-density genotyping and analysis confirm the presence of allelic heterogeneity, allow the identification of population-specific variants, and limit the number of candidate SNPs for functional studies.},

abstract = {Genetic variants associated with fasting glucose in European ancestry populations are increasingly well understood. However, the nature of the associations between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting glucose in other racial and ethnic groups is unclear. We sought to examine regions previously identified to be associated with fasting glucose in Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across multiple ethnicities in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Nondiabetic MESA participants with fasting glucose measured at the baseline exam and with GWAS genotyping were included; 2,349 Caucasians, 664 individuals of Chinese descent, 1,366 African Americans, and 1,171 Hispanics. Genotype data were generated from the Affymetrix 6.0 array and imputation in IMPUTE. Fasting glucose was regressed on SNP dosage data in each ethnic group adjusting for age, gender, MESA study center, and ethnic-specific principal components. SNPs from the three gene regions with the strongest associations to fasting glucose in previous Caucasian GWAS (MTNR1B / GCK / G6PC2) were examined in depth. There was limited power to replicate associations in other ethnic groups due to smaller allele frequencies and limited sample size; SNP associations may also have differed across ethnic groups due to differing linkage disequilibrium patterns with causal variants. rs10830963 in MTNR1B and rs4607517 in GCK demonstrated consistent magnitude and direction of association with fasting glucose across ethnic groups, although the associations were often not nominally significant. In conclusion, certain SNPs in MTNR1B and GCK demonstrate consistent effects across four racial and ethnic groups, narrowing the putative region for these causal variants.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected many disease associations. However, the reported variants tend to explain small fractions of risk, and there are doubts about issues such as the portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian ancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds Ratios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlying causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries. Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly between populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger sample sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to common variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and the high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.},

Despite these successes, the variants identified by these studies have generally explained only a small fraction of the heritable component of disease risk, and have not pinpointed with certainty the causal variant(s) at the associated loci. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action by which associated loci influence disease or quantitative phenotypes are often unclear, because we do not know through which gene(s) the associated variants exert their effects or because these gene(s) are of unknown function or have no clear connection to known disease biology. Thus, the initial set of genome-wide association studies serve as a starting point for future genetic and functional studies. We outline possible next steps that may help accelerate progress from genetic studies to the biological knowledge that can guide the development of predictive, preventive, or therapeutic measures.},

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

abstract = {The advent of genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screens puts us in the position to identify genes for all functions human cells carry out. However, for many functions, assay complexity and cost make genome-scale knockdown experiments impossible. Methods to predict genes required for cell functions are therefore needed to focus RNAi screens from the whole genome on the most likely candidates. Although different bioinformatics tools for gene function prediction exist, they lack experimental validation and are therefore rarely used by experimentalists. To address this, we developed an effective computational gene selection strategy that represents public data about genes as graphs and then analyzes these graphs using kernels on graph nodes to predict functional relationships. To demonstrate its performance, we predicted human genes required for a poorly understood cellular function-mitotic chromosome condensation-and experimentally validated the top 100 candidates with a focused RNAi screen by automated microscopy. Quantitative analysis of the images demonstrated that the candidates were indeed strongly enriched in condensation genes, including the discovery of several new factors. By combining bioinformatics prediction with experimental validation, our study shows that kernels on graph nodes are powerful tools to integrate public biological data and predict genes involved in cellular functions of interest.},

They are presented in a unified framework together with a wide range of evaluation tools, which are mandatory in assessing the efficiency and the quality of the data integration process. We provide a systematic description of the MAGE data integration methodology together with some basic recommendation to help the users in choosing the appropriate tools to integrate MAGE data for large-scale analysis; and also how to evaluate them from different perspectives in order to quantify their efficiency.

In summary, we can have a mathematical model of the probability that certain observ-able events happen. Thismathematical model has parameters. The values of the parameters determine the exact probabilities generated by the model. Our beliefs regard the possi- ble values of the parameters. We may believe strongly in some parameter values but less strongly in other values. The form of our beliefs about various parameter values can itself be expressed as a mathematical model, with its own (hyper-)parameters.

2.1.2 Prior and posterior beliefs
This is called a prior belief because it's our belief before taking into account some particular set of observations.
These are called a posterior belief because they are computed after taking into account a particular set of observations
Bayesian inference gets us from prior to posterior beliefs
the prior is simply the belief we hold by excluding a particular set of data, and the posterior is the belief we hold by including the set of data

2.2 Three goals for inference fromdata2.2.1 Estimation of parameter values
The posterior beliefs typically increase the magnitude of belief in some parameter values, while lessening the degree of belief in other parameter values.

2.2.2 Prediction of data values
In Bayesian inference, to predict data values, we typically take a weighted average of
our beliefs. We let each belief make its individual prediction, and then we weigh each of those predictions according to how strongly we believe in them.

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown a large number of genetic variants to be associated with complex diseases. The identification of the causal variant within an associated locus can sometimes be difficult because of the linkage disequilibrium between the associated variants and because most GWAS loci contain multiple genes, or no genes at all. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is a method used to determine the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels. eQTL mapping studies have enabled the prioritization of genetic variants within GWAS loci, and have shown that trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often function in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner, sometimes having downstream effects on completely different chromosomes. Furthermore, recent RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies have shown that a large repertoire of transcripts is available in cells, which are actively regulated by (trait-associated) variants. Future eQTL mapping studies will focus on broadening the range of available tissues and cell types, in order to determine the key tissues and cell types involved in complex traits. Finally, large meta-analyses will be able to pinpoint the causal variants within the trait-associated loci and determine their downstream effects in greater detail.

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

Meanwhile, brain imaging studies are increasing in size and scope, revealing disease and genetic effects on brain structure and function, and implicating neural pathways and causal mechanisms. With the advent of global neuroimaging consortia, imaging studies are now well powered to discover genetic variants that reliably affect the brain. Genetic analyses of brain measures from tens of thousands of people are being extended to test genetic associations with signals at millions of locations in the brain, and connectome-wide, genome-wide scans can jointly screen brain circuits and genomes; these analyses and others present new statistical challenges. There is a growing need for the community to establish and enforce standards in this developing field to ensure robust findings. Here we discuss how neuroimagers and geneticists have formed alliances to discover how genetic factors affect the brain. The field is rapidly advancing with ultra-high-resolution imaging and whole-genome sequencing. We recommend a rigorous approach to neuroimaging genomics that capitalizes on its recent successes and ensures the reliability of future discoveries.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified many variants that each affects multiple traits, particularly across autoimmune diseases, cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that pleiotropic effects on human complex traits may be widespread. However, systematic detection of such effects is challenging and requires new methodologies and frameworks for interpreting cross-phenotype results. In this Review, we discuss the evidence for pleiotropy in contemporary genetic mapping studies, new and established analytical approaches to identifying pleiotropic effects, sources of spurious cross-phenotype effects and study design considerations. We also outline the molecular and clinical implications of such findings and discuss future directions of research.},
annote = {Crossphenotype (CP) associations:
- many genetic loci appear to harbour variants that are associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly distinct traits
- occurs when a genetic locus is associated with more than one trait in a study, regardless of the under- lying cause for the observed association. 

Pleiotropy:
- A gene or genetic variant that affects more than one phenotypic trait
- one possible underlying cause for an observed CP association

CP effects in GWASs mirror epidemiological observations of shared heritability and comorbidity. Co-occurrence of multiple diseases in the same individual also pointto shared genetic causes.

Three types of CP : 
1. biological pleiotropy: genetic variant or gene that has a direct biological influence on more than one phenotypic trait. 
- at the allelic level, where a single causal variant is related to multiple phenotypes (FIG. 1a)
- at the gene (or region) level, at which multiple variants in the same gene (or region) are associated with different pheno- types
- several scenarios:
-- distinct effects of the same allele in different cell populations underlying associations with different diseases or disease groups
-- a single molecular effect having multiple morphological or physiological consequences
-- a CP effect tagging two different causal variants within the same gene (
2. mediated pleiotropy: one phenotype is itself causally related to a second phenotype so that a variant associated with the first phenotype is indirectly associated with the second
- the genetic variant will be associated with both phenotypes if tested separately
- the association between the genetic variant and the second phenotype (that is, target pheno- type) can be tested while adjusting or stratifying by the first (that is, intermediate phenotype)
- Mendelian randomization: This framework for causal inference tests whether the intermediate phenotype causally affects the target phenotype. Specifically, if the effect of a genetic variant can be taken as a proxy for the inter- mediate phenotype, this is used to establish the causal relationship between the intermediate phenotype and the disease.

3. spurious pleiotropy: various sources of bias that cause a genetic variant falsely to appear to be associated with multiple phenotypes
- defects in the studies that identify CP effects:
-- ascertainment bias: recruitment of individuals with one phenotype increases the prevalence of a second unrelated phenotype92in the cohort and thus the spurious correlation between them 
-- phenotypic misclassification: misclassification rate must be quite high94to have a substantial impact on the genetic correlation
-- shared controls: If the participant overlap is not accounted for, the estimates of effects can be biased, and the discovery power may be reduced
- ambiguity in mapping the true underlying causal variant: In regions of high LD, a SNP could tag multiple causal variants located in different genes with completely different functions and thus lead to a spurious CP finding

A CP association can be observed for an individual SNP or at the level of a gene or region (including in non- coding DNA), in which different independent variants in the same gene or region affect multiple phenotypes

Analytical strategies to identify CP effects
1. multivariate approaches:
- Multivariate analyses jointly analyse more than one phenotype in a unified frame- work and test for the association of multiple pheno- types with a genetic variant
- type of traits:
-- continuous phenotypes: 
--- a multivariate regression framework (such as a multivariate analysis of variance
--- generalized estimating equations (GEE), to allow non-normally distributed phenotypes
--- Ordinal regression uses the genotypeas the outcome variable and the set of phenotypes as the predictors
--- Canonical correlation analysis extracts a linear combination of the phenotypes that explains the largest amount of covariation with the genetic variant. The weights for the linear combination will differ for each genetic variant, in contrast to PCA, and will provide information about which phenotypes are most strongly related
2. univariate approaches 
- As the genetic effects for most complex traits are small, combining results across studies of different phenotypes can improve the power of detecting CP associations. This improvement in power will generally outweigh the advantages of using one study in which individuals are phenotyped on all traits. Another advantage of univariate approaches is that, unlike multivariate approaches, most of them are based on summary statistics, which do not divulge individuallevel data and thus maintain participant confidentiality
- Meta-analytical approaches aggregate summary statistics from individ- ual studies into one statistic to test for CP effects and can be applied genome-wide or on a prespecified set of SNPs
-- methods based on association P values ignore allelic effect direction (a positive versus negative effect on the trait) and effect heterogeneity (different effect sizes across traits)
--- CPMA: tests whether the observed P values deviate from the expected dis- tribution of P values under the null hypothesis of no additional associations beyond those already known
--- Fixed-effects meta-analysis assumes that the genetic variant has the same effect on each pheno- type, whereas random-effects meta-analysis allows the genetic effect to differ across phenotypes.
--- subset-based meta-analysis: extends standard fixed-effects meta-analysis to allow for opposite effects and to include situations in which association is only to a subset of traits. This method exhaustively evaluates all possible combinations of non-null models for associa- tion, selects the strongest association and then adjusts for the multiple comparisons generated by the search
--- Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes' (TATES) procedure was developed to detect effects across correlated traits measured in the same individuals but in contrast uses the P value for each trait
-- methods based on the effect sizes are sensitive to allelic effect direction and effect size (in GWAS often not necessary since effect sizesquite small)

If a single variant or variants in the same gene are causal for the diseases, this indicates biological pleiotropy, whereas causal variants in different genes that are in LD is suggestive of spurious pleiotropy.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to model and recapitulate various known disease features in hearts of patient donors harboring genetic-based cardiac diseases. Experimental drugs have also been tested in this setting and shown to alleviate disease phenotypes in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, further paving the way for therapeutic interventions for cardiac disease. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods to generate high-quality hiPSC and differentiate them towards cardiomyocytes as well as the full range of genetic-based cardiac diseases, which have been modeled using hiPSC.

abstract = {Detection and assessment of the effect of a modifiable risk factor on a disease with view to informing public health intervention policies are of fundamental concern in aetiological epidemiology. In order to have solid evidence that such a public health intervention has the desired effect, it is necessary to ascertain that an observed association or correlation between a risk factor and a disease means that the risk factor is causal for the disease. Inferring causality from observational data is difficult, typically due to confounding by social, behavioural, or physiological factors which are difficult to control for and particularly difficult to measure accurately. A possible approach to inferring causality when confounding is believed to be present but unobservable, as it may not even be fully understood, is based on the method of instrumental variables and is known under the name of Mendelian randomisation if the instrument is a genetic variant. While testing for the presence of a causal effect using this method is generally straightforward, point estimates of such an effect are only obtainable under additional parametric assumptions. This chapter introduces the concept and illustrates the method and its assumptions with simple real-life examples. It concludes with a brief discussion on pitfalls and limitations.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization--the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception--provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization--the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.  Genetic epidemiology--the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology--is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net--http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge--in terms of genetic tests and services--for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context--and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7-10 This approach has recently been referred to as  Mendelian randomization'.11-15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.  Box 1 Nature announces a genetic epidemiology initiative alongside a cartoon illustrating the demise of classical epidemiology. Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment'  A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology.

abstract = {During the past ten years the field of human disease genetics has made major leaps, including the completion of the Human Genome Project, the HapMap Project, the development of the genome-wide association (GWA) studies to identify common disease-predisposing variants and the introduction of large-scale whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing studies. The introduction of new technologies has enabled researchers to utilize novel study designs to tackle previously unexplored research questions in human genomics. These new types of studies typically need large sample sizes to overcome the multiple testing challenges caused by the huge number of interrogated genetic variants. As a consequence, large consortia-studies are at present the default in disease genetics research. The systematic planning of the GWA-studies was a key element in the success of the approach. Similar planning and rigor in statistical inferences will probably be beneficial also to future sequencing studies. Already today, the next-generation exome sequencing has led to the identification of several genes underlying Mendelian diseases. In spite of the clear benefits, the method has proven to be more challenging than anticipated. In the case of complex diseases, next-generation sequencing aims to identify disease-associated low-frequency alleles. However, their robust detection will require very large study samples, even larger than in the case of the GWA-studies. This has stimulated study designs that capitalize on enriching sets of low-frequency alleles, for example, studies focusing on population isolates such as Finland or Iceland. One example is the collaborative SISu Project (Sequencing Initiative Suomi) that aims to provide near complete genome variation information from Finnish study samples and pave the way for large, nationwide genome health initiative studies.},

We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

- Reason why the SNPs do not explain the full estimated heritability: SNPs on the arrays are not in complete LD with causal variants
--{\textgreater} ability of the SNPs to explain the phenotypic variation caused by causal variants depends on the LD between all the causal variants and all the SNPs
--{\textgreater} Lack of complete LD is manifested as a difference between the genomic relationship of each pair of subjects j and k at the causal variants (Gjk) and the relationship between the same individuals calculated from the SNPs (Ajk)
- It is likely that the causal variants and the SNPs have different properties, so LD among SNPs is only a guide to LD between causal variants and SNPs --{\textgreater} One way in which the causal variants may differ from the SNPs is in MAF
1. Split SNPs into two groups, the first representing SNPs and the second representing causal variants, and estimated genetic relationships using all of the SNPs in the first group (Ajk) and using SNPs with MAF ≤ $\theta$ in the second group (proxy for Gjk)
2. calibrate the predicTion error by calculating the regression of Gjk on Ajk
- causal polymorphisms tend to have lower MAF than the SNPs that have been assayed, as expected from neutral and selection theories of quantitative genetic variation we expect the LD between SNPs and causal variants to be reduced

Variance explained does not depend on number of SNPs 
When the relationship estimates are adjusted for prediction error, the proportions of variance explained are independent of the number of SNPs and agree with an estimate of {\~{}}0.54 but have larger s.e. when fewer SNPs are used

Discussion 
- If causal variants affecting height had no effect on fitness, they would show a complete range of MAF, but with a higher proportion at low MAF than the SNPs on commercial arrays. If variants affecting height are subject to selec- tion for either allele, there will still be a spectrum of MAF, but with an even greater proportion at low MAF
- spectrum of MAF at causal variants is more concentrated at low values than it is for the SNPs used as markers
- data provide strong evidence that the variation contributed by many of these causal variants is likely to be small and that very large sample sizes will be required to show that their individual effects are statistically significant},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptional regulation is an important part of regulatory control in eukaryotes. Even if binding motifs for transcription factors are known, the task of finding binding sites by scanning sequences is plagued by false positives. One way to improve the detection of binding sites from motifs is by taking cooperativity of transcription factor binding into account. We propose a non-parametric probabilistic model, similar to a document topic model, for detecting transcriptional programs, groups of cooperative transcription factors and co-regulated genes. The analysis results in transcriptional programs which generalise both transcriptional modules and TF-target gene incidence matrices and provide a higher-level summary of these structures. The method is independent of prior specification of training sets of genes, for example, via gene expression data. The analysis is based on known binding motifs.

RESULTS: We applied our method to putative regulatory regions of 18,445 Mus musculus genes. We discovered just 68 transcriptional programs that effectively summarised the action of 149 transcription factors on these genes. Several of these programs were significantly enriched for known biological processes and signalling pathways. One transcriptional program has a significant overlap with a reference set of cell cycle specific transcription factors.

CONCLUSION: Our method is able to pick out higher order structure from noisy sequence analyses. The transcriptional programs it identifies potentially represent common mechanisms of regulatory control across the genome. It simultaneously predicts which genes are co-regulated and which sets of transcription factors cooperate to achieve this co-regulation. The programs we discovered enable biologists to choose new genes and transcription factors to study in specific transcriptional regulatory systems.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) search for associations between genetic variants and disease status, typically via logistic regression. Often there are covariates, such as sex or well-established major genetic factors, that are known to affect disease susceptibility and are independent of tested genotypes at the population level. We show theoretically and with data from recent GWAS on multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis that inclusion of known covariates can substantially reduce power for the identification of associated variants when the disease prevalence is lower than a few percent. Whether the inclusion of such covariates reduces or increases power to detect genetic effects depends on various factors, including the prevalence of the disease studied. When the disease is common (prevalence of {\textgreater}20{\%}), the inclusion of covariates typically increases power, whereas, for rarer diseases, it can often decrease power to detect new genetic associations.},

One critical aspect of GWAS QC is evaluating genotype cluster plots to verify sensible genotype calling in putatively associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Evoker is a tool for visualizing genotype cluster plots, and provides a solution to the computational and storage problems related to working with such large datasets.

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are useful for nominating candidate genes, but typically are unable to establish disease causality or differentiate between the effects of variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Additionally, some GWAS loci might contain multiple causative variants or genes that contribute to the overall disease susceptibility at a single locus. However, the majority of current GWAS lack the statistical power to test whether multiple causative genes underlie the same locus, prompting us to adopt an alternative approach to testing multiple GWAS genes empirically. We used gene targeting in a disease-susceptible rat model of genetic hypertension to test all six genes at the Agtrap-Plod1 locus (Agtrap, Mthfr, Clcn6, Nppa, Nppb, and Plod1) for blood pressure (BP) and renal phenotypes. This revealed that the majority of genes at this locus (five out of six) can impact hypertension by modifying BP and renal phenotypes. Mutations of Nppa, Plod1, and Mthfr increased disease susceptibility, whereas Agtrap and Clcn6 mutations decreased hypertension risk. Reanalysis of the human AGTRAP-PLOD1 locus also implied that disease-associated haplotype blocks with polygenic effects were not only possible, but rather were highly plausible. Combined, these data demonstrate for the first time that multiple modifiers of hypertension can cosegregate at a single GWAS locus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is to isolate DNA markers for variants affecting phenotypes of interest. This is constrained by the fact that the number of markers often far exceeds the number of samples. Compressed sensing (CS) is a body of theory regarding signal recovery when the number of predictor variables (i.e., genotyped markers) exceeds the sample size. Its applicability to GWAS has not been investigated.

RESULTS: Using CS theory, we show that all markers with nonzero coefficients can be identified (selected) using an efficient algorithm, provided that they are sufficiently few in number (sparse) relative to sample size. For heritability equal to one (h (2) = 1), there is a sharp phase transition from poor performance to complete selection as the sample size is increased. For heritability below one, complete selection still occurs, but the transition is smoothed. We find for h (2) ∼ 0.5 that a sample size of approximately thirty times the number of markers with nonzero coefficients is sufficient for full selection. This boundary is only weakly dependent on the number of genotyped markers.

CONCLUSION: Practical measures of signal recovery are robust to linkage disequilibrium between a true causal variant and markers residing in the same genomic region. Given a limited sample size, it is possible to discover a phase transition by increasing the penalization; in this case a subset of the support may be recovered. Applying this approach to the GWAS analysis of height, we show that 70-100{\%} of the selected markers are strongly correlated with height-associated markers identified by the GIANT Consortium.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have uncovered hundreds of common genetic variants involved in complex diseases. However, for most complex diseases, these common genetic variants only marginally contribute to disease susceptibility. It is now argued that rare variants located in different genes could in fact play a more important role in disease susceptibility than common variants. These rare genetic variants were not captured by genome-wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphism-chips but with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, they have become detectable. It is now possible to study their contribution to common disease by resequencing samples of cases and controls or by using new genotyping exome arrays that cover rare alleles. In this review, we address the question of the contribution of rare variants in common disease by taking the examples of different diseases for which some resequencing studies have already been performed, and by summarizing the results of simulation studies conducted so far to investigate the genetic architecture of complex traits in human. So far, empirical data have not allowed the exclusion of many models except the most extreme ones involving only a small number of rare variants with large effects contributing to complex disease. To unravel the genetic architecture of complex disease, case-control data will not be sufficient, and alternative study designs need to be proposed together with methodological developments.},

abstract = {We present PEER (probabilistic estimation of expression residuals), a software package implementing statistical models that improve the sensitivity and interpretability of genetic associations in population-scale expression data. This approach builds on factor analysis methods that infer broad variance components in the measurements. PEER takes as input transcript profiles and covariates from a set of individuals, and then outputs hidden factors that explain much of the expression variability. Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability. PEER extends previous related surrogate variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {The term manifold learning encompasses a class of machine learning techniques that convert data from a high to lower dimensional representation while respecting the intrinsic geometry of the data. The intuition underlying the use of manifold learning in the context of image analysis is that, while each image may be viewed as a single point in a very high-dimensional space, a set of such points for a population of images may be well represented by a sub-manifold of the space that is likely to be non-linear and of a significantly lower dimension. Recently, manifold learning techniques have begun to be applied to the field of medical image analysis. This chapter will review the most popular manifold learning techniques such as Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), Isomap, Local linear embedding, and Laplacian eigenmaps. It will also demonstrate how these techniques can be used for image registration, segmentation, and biomarker discovery from medical images.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the cardiovascular system has evolved through the years by extensive studies emphasizing the identification of the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in its normal function and disease pathogenesis. Major discoveries have been made along the way. However, the majority of this work has focused on specific genes or pathways rather than integrative approaches. In cardiomyopathies alone, over 30 different loci have shown mutations with varying inheritance patterns, yet mostly coding for structural proteins. The emergence of microarrays in the early 1990s paved the way to a new era of cardiovascular research. Microarrays dramatically accelerated the rhythm of discoveries by giving us the ability to simultaneously study thousands of genes in a single experiment. In the field of cardiovascular research, microarrays are having a significant contribution, with the majority of work focusing on end-stage cardiomyopathies that lead to heart failure. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, known pathways are seen under new light, disease subgroups begin to emerge, and the effects of various drugs are molecularly dissected. This cross-study data comparison concludes that consistent energy metabolism gene expression changes occur across dilated, hypertrophic, and ischemic cardiomyopathies, while Ca2+ homeostasis changes are prominent in the first two cardiomyopathies, and structural gene expression changes accompany mostly the dilated form. Gene expression changes are further correlated to disease genetics. The future of microarrays in the cardiomyopathy field is discussed with an emphasis on optimum experimental design and on applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) measurements, exercise responses to standardized treadmill test (ETT) and brachial artery (BA) vascular function are heritable traits that are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the community-based Framingham Heart Study.

METHODS: We estimated multivariable-adjusted residuals for quantitative echocardiography, ETT and BA function traits. Echocardiography residuals were averaged across 4 examinations and included LV mass, diastolic and systolic dimensions, wall thickness, fractional shortening, left atrial and aortic root size. ETT measures (single exam) included systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses during exercise stage 2, and at 3 minutes post-exercise. BA measures (single exam) included vessel diameter, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and baseline and hyperemic flow responses. Generalized estimating equations (GEE), family-based association tests (FBAT) and variance-components linkage were used to relate multivariable-adjusted trait residuals to 70,987 SNPs (Human 100K GeneChip, Affymetrix) restricted to autosomal SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or =0.10, genotype call rate {\textgreater} or =0.80, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p {\textgreater} or = 0.001.

RESULTS: We summarize results from 17 traits in up to 1238 related middle-aged to elderly men and women. Results of all association and linkage analyses are web-posted at http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. We confirmed modest-to-strong heritabilities (estimates 0.30-0.52) for several Echo, ETT and BA function traits. Overall, p {\textless} 10(-5) in either GEE or FBAT models were observed for 21 SNPs (nine for echocardiography, eleven for ETT and one for BA function). The top SNPs associated were (GEE results): LV diastolic dimension, rs1379659 (SLIT2, p = 1.17*10(-7)); LV systolic dimension, rs10504543 (KCNB2, p = 5.18*10(-6)); LV mass, rs10498091 (p = 5.68*10(-6)); Left atrial size, rs1935881 (FAM5C, p = 6.56*10(-6)); exercise heart rate, rs6847149 (NOLA1, p = 2.74*10(-6)); exercise systolic blood pressure, rs2553268 (WRN, p = 6.3*10(-6)); BA baseline flow, rs3814219 (OBFC1, 9.48*10(-7)), and FMD, rs4148686 (CFTR, p = 1.13*10(-5)). Several SNPs are reasonable biological candidates, with some being related to multiple traits suggesting pleiotropy. The peak LOD score was for LV mass (4.38; chromosome 5); the 1.5 LOD support interval included NRG2.

CONCLUSION: In hypothesis-generating GWAS of echocardiography, ETT and BA vascular function in a moderate-sized community-based sample, we identified several SNPs that are candidates for replication attempts and we provide a web-based GWAS resource for the research community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and validation study for left ventricular (LV) mass in the Family Blood Pressure Program-HyperGEN population. LV mass is a sensitive predictor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in all genders, races, and ages. Polymorphisms of candidate genes in diverse pathways have been associated with LV mass. However, subsequent studies have often failed to replicate these associations. Genome-wide association studies have unprecedented power to identify potential genes with modest effects on left LV mass. We describe here a GWAS for LV mass in Caucasians using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100 k Set. Cases (N = 101) and controls (N = 101) were selected from extreme tails of the LV mass index distribution from 906 individuals in the HyperGEN study. Eleven of 12 promising (Q {\textless} 0.8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the genome-wide study were successfully genotyped using quantitative real time PCR in a validation study. RESULTS: Despite the relatively small sample, we identified 12 promising SNPs in the GWAS. Eleven SNPs were successfully genotyped in the validation study of 704 Caucasians and 1467 African Americans; 5 SNPs on chromosomes 5, 12, and 20 were significantly (P {\textless} or = 0.05) associated with LV mass after correction for multiple testing. One SNP (rst is intragenic within KCNB1, which is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, a previously reported candidate gene for LV hypertrophy within this population. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest KCNB1 may be involved in the development of LV hypertrophy in humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using data from 4 community-based cohorts of African Americans, we tested the association between genome-wide markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and cardiac phenotypes in the Candidate-gene Association Resource study.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 6765 African Americans, we related age, sex, height, and weight-adjusted residuals for 9 cardiac phenotypes (assessed by echocardiogram or magnetic resonance imaging) to 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped using Genome-wide Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affy6.0) and the remainder imputed. Within the cohort, genome-wide association analysis was conducted, followed by meta-analysis across cohorts using inverse variance weights (genome-wide significance threshold=4.0 ×10(-7)). Supplementary pathway analysis was performed. We attempted replication in 3 smaller cohorts of African ancestry and tested lookups in 1 consortium of European ancestry (EchoGEN). Across the 9 phenotypes, variants in 4 genetic loci reached genome-wide significance: rs4552931 in UBE2V2 (P=1.43×10(-7)) for left ventricular mass, rs7213314 in WIPI1 (P=1.68×10(-7)) for left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, rs1571099 in PPAPDC1A (P=2.57×10(-8)) for interventricular septal wall thickness, and rs9530176 in KLF5 (P=4.02×10(-7)) for ejection fraction. Associated variants were enriched in 3 signaling pathways involved in cardiac remodeling. None of the 4 loci replicated in cohorts of African ancestry was confirmed in lookups in EchoGEN.

CONCLUSIONS: In the largest genome-wide association study of cardiac structure and function to date in African Americans, we identified 4 genetic loci related to left ventricular mass, interventricular septal wall thickness, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, and ejection fraction, which reached genome-wide significance. Replication results suggest that these loci may be unique to individuals of African ancestry. Additional large-scale studies are warranted for these complex phenotypes.},

abstract = {In this review, we discuss current evidence linking environmental pollutants to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Extensive evidence indicates that environmental factors contribute to CVD risk, incidence, and severity. Migrant studies show that changes in the environment could substantially alter CVD risk in a genetically stable population. Additionally, CVD risk is affected by changes in nutritional and lifestyle choices. Recent studies in the field of environmental cardiology suggest that environmental toxins also influence CVD. Exposure to tobacco smoke is paradigmatic of such environmental risk and is strongly and positively associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In animal models of exposure, tobacco smoke induces endothelial dysfunction and prothrombotic responses and exacerbates atherogenesis and myocardial ischemic injury. Similar mechanism may be engaged by other pollutants or food constituents. Several large population-based studies indicate that exposure to fine or ultrafine particulate air pollution increases CVD morbidity and mortality, and the plausibility of this association is supported by data from animal studies. Exposure to other chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and metals has also been reported to elevate CVD risk by affecting atherogenesis, thrombosis, or blood pressure regulation. Maternal exposure to drugs, toxins, and infection has been linked with cardiac birth defects and premature CVD in later life. Collectively, the data support the notion that chronic environmental stress is an important determinant of CVD risk. Further work is required to assess the magnitude of this risk fully and to delineate specific mechanisms by which environmental toxins affect CVD.},

abstract = {Background This review discusses the incidence and importance of congenital heart disease (CHD), the reasons that investigation of causative mechanisms for human CHD has been slow, and the limitations of the multifactorial theory for the etiology of CHD.  Methods and Results The molecular defects underlying three vasculopathies--Marfan's syndrome (fibrillin), supravalvar aortic stenosis, and Williams' syndrome (elastin)--and hereditary telangiectasia are presented to emphasize the role of microfibrils and extracellular matrix in the pathophysiology of these vascular defects. Animal models of CHD, including situs inversus, canine conotruncal malformations, and chick neural crest ablation, are examined to emphasize how such studies relate to human CHD, especially by pointing to single-gene defects for conotruncal malformations, candidate loci for situs inversus, and phenotypic variability caused by neural crest lesions. The crucial role of cardiac transcription factors in heart morphogenesis is emphasized by review of gene knockout studies of these factors, which cause fetal death secondary to heart maldevelopment. Several lines of evidence demonstrating genetic etiologies of human CHD are also presented, including the mapping of familial atrial septal defects, to prove that one anatomic type of CHD may be due to single-gene defects at different loci. Review of atrioventricular canal, both secondary to trisomy 21 and as an autosomal-dominant familial defect, reiterates this conclusion. The evidence that monosomy on chromosome 22 causes multiple types of CHD, including aortic arch and conotruncal defects as part of the CATCH-22 syndrome, is presented, with results supporting the idea that deletions at this site alone may cause 5{\%} of surgically treated CHD.  Conclusions We conclude that (1) human CHD is frequently due to single-gene defects and that even sporadic defects may arise from a single-gene abnormality; (2) a common genetic defect may cause several apparently different forms of CHD; (3) elucidation of the genetic basis of CHD provides clues to normal cardiovascular developmental biology; (4) the same cardiac malformation can be caused by mutant genes at different loci; and (5) interactions of clinical investigators (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons) with basic scientists should allow more rapid progress in defining the genetic basis of CHD.},

Molecular dissection of the 22q11 region to find the genes which produce the outflow-tract defects and other disorders of neural crest migration has proven more difficult, as there are a large number of genes in the deleted region. Classic mapping studies have located a gene which can cause total anomalous venous drainage near the centromere of chromosome 4. Knockout mouse studies have demonstrated an important role in cardiac development for, amongst others, endothelin-1 and neuregulin. Functional redundancy and maternal rescue are two reasons why knockouts do not always live up to our expectations. Serendipitous findings in the mouse are equally important. Work continues to isolate the inversion of embryo turning (inv) gene which invariably disturb the left--{\textgreater}right gradient in homozygotes, causing heart defects in many instances. Sadly, the original insertional mutation has resulted in a complex deletion duplication which has slowed discovery of the coding sequence.},

abstract = {The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO) malformations, aortic valve stenosis (AVS), coarctation of the aorta (COA), and hypoplastic left heart (HLH) constitute a mechanistically defined subgroup of congenital heart defects that have substantial evidence for a genetic component. Evidence from echocardiography studies has shown that bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is found frequently in relatives of children with LVOTO defects. However, formal inheritance analysis has not been performed. We ascertained 124 families by an index case with AVS, COA, or HLH. A total of 413 relatives were enrolled in the study, of which 351 had detailed echocardiography exams for structural heart defects and measurements of a variety of aortic arch, left ventricle, and valve structures. LVOTO malformations were noted in 30 relatives (18 BAV, 5 HLH, 3 COA, and 3 AVS), along with significant congenital heart defects (CHD) in 2 others (32/413; 7.7{\%}). Relative risk for first-degree relatives in this group was 36.9, with a heritability of 0.71-0.90. Formal segregation analysis suggests that one or more minor loci with rare dominant alleles may be operative in a subset of families. Multiplex relative risk analysis, which estimates number of loci, had the highest maximum likelihood score in a model with 2 loci (range of 1-6 in the lod-1 support interval). Heritability of several aortic arch measurements and aortic valve was significant. These data support a complex but most likely oligogenic pattern of inheritance. A combination of linkage and association study designs is likely to enable LVOTO risk gene identification. This data can also provide families with important information for screening asymptomatic relatives for potentially harmful cardiac defects.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) structure and function are heritable phenotypes of cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: To identify common genetic variants associated with cardiac structure and function by conducting a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 5 population-based cohort studies (stage 1) with replication (stage 2) in 2 other community-based samples.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Within each of 5 community-based cohorts comprising the EchoGen consortium (stage 1; n = 12 612 individuals of European ancestry; 55{\%} women, aged 26-95 years; examinations between 1978-2008), we estimated the association between approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; imputed to the HapMap CEU panel) and echocardiographic traits. In stage 2, SNPs significantly associated with traits in stage 1 were tested for association in 2 other cohorts (n = 4094 people of European ancestry). Using a prespecified P value threshold of 5 x 10(-7) to indicate genome-wide significance, we performed an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association data from each cohort.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic traits: LV mass, internal dimensions, wall thickness, systolic dysfunction, aortic root, and left atrial size.

RESULTS: In stage 1, 16 genetic loci were associated with 5 echocardiographic traits: 1 each with LV internal dimensions and systolic dysfunction, 3 each with LV mass and wall thickness, and 8 with aortic root size. In stage 2, 5 loci replicated (6q22 locus associated with LV diastolic dimensions, explaining {\textless}1{\%} of trait variance; 5q23, 12p12, 12q14, and 17p13 associated with aortic root size, explaining 1{\%}-3{\%} of trait variance).

CONCLUSIONS: We identified 5 genetic loci harboring common variants that were associated with variation in LV diastolic dimensions and aortic root size, but such findings explained a very small proportion of variance. Further studies are required to replicate these findings, identify the causal variants at or near these loci, characterize their functional significance, and determine whether they are related to overt cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Abstract Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{\textless}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{\textless}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and ∼ 2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P {\textless} 5 × 10⁻⁸), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.},

These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours.

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Imputation is an extremely valuable tool in conducting and synthesising genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Directly typed SNP quality control (QC) is thought to affect imputation quality. It is, therefore, common practise to use quality-controlled (QCed) data as an input for imputing genotypes. This study aims to determine the effect of commonly applied QC steps on imputation outcomes. We performed several iterations of imputing SNPs across chromosome 22 in a dataset consisting of 3177 samples with Illumina 610 k (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) GWAS data, applying different QC steps each time. The imputed genotypes were compared with the directly typed genotypes. In addition, we investigated the correlation between alternatively QCed data. We also applied a series of post-imputation QC steps balancing elimination of poorly imputed SNPs and information loss. We found that the difference between the unQCed data and the fully QCed data on imputation outcome was minimal. Our study shows that imputation of common variants is generally very accurate and robust to GWAS QC, which is not a major factor affecting imputation outcome. A minority of common-frequency SNPs with particular properties cannot be accurately imputed regardless of QC stringency. These findings may not generalise to the imputation of low frequency and rare variants.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation, used in genome-wide association studies to expand coverage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has performed poorly in African Americans compared to less admixed populations. Overall, imputation has typically relied on HapMap reference haplotype panels from Africans (YRI), European Americans (CEU), and Asians (CHB/JPT). The 1000 Genomes project offers a wider range of reference populations, such as African Americans (ASW), but their imputation performance has had limited evaluation. Using 595 African Americans genotyped on Illumina's HumanHap550v3 BeadChip, we compared imputation results from four software programs (IMPUTE2, BEAGLE, MaCH, and MaCH-Admix) and three reference panels consisting of different combinations of 1000 Genomes populations (February 2012 release): (1) 3 specifically selected populations (YRI, CEU, and ASW); (2) 8 populations of diverse African (AFR) or European (AFR) descent; and (3) all 14 available populations (ALL). Based on chromosome 22, we calculated three performance metrics: (1) concordance (percentage of masked genotyped SNPs with imputed and true genotype agreement); (2) imputation quality score (IQS; concordance adjusted for chance agreement, which is particularly informative for low minor allele frequency [MAF] SNPs); and (3) average r2hat (estimated correlation between the imputed and true genotypes, for all imputed SNPs). Across the reference panels, IMPUTE2 and MaCH had the highest concordance (91{\%}-93{\%}), but IMPUTE2 had the highest IQS (81{\%}-83{\%}) and average r2hat (0.68 using YRI+ASW+CEU, 0.62 using AFR+EUR, and 0.55 using ALL). Imputation quality for most programs was reduced by the addition of more distantly related reference populations, due entirely to the introduction of low frequency SNPs (MAF≤2{\%}) that are monomorphic in the more closely related panels. While imputation was optimized by using IMPUTE2 with reference to the ALL panel (average r2hat = 0.86 for SNPs with MAF{\textgreater}2{\%}), use of the ALL panel for African American studies requires careful interpretation of the population specificity and imputation quality of low frequency SNPs.},

abstract = {Imputation-based association methods provide a powerful framework for testing untyped variants for association with phenotypes and for combining results from multiple studies that use different genotyping platforms. Here, we consider several issues that arise when applying these methods in practice, including: (i) factors affecting imputation accuracy, including choice of reference panel; (ii) the effects of imputation accuracy on power to detect associations; (iii) the relative merits of Bayesian and frequentist approaches to testing imputed genotypes for association with phenotype; and (iv) how to quickly and accurately compute Bayes factors for testing imputed SNPs. We find that imputation-based methods can be robust to imputation accuracy and can improve power to detect associations, even when average imputation accuracy is poor. We explain how ranking SNPs for association by a standard likelihood ratio test gives the same results as a Bayesian procedure that uses an unnatural prior assumption--specifically, that difficult-to-impute SNPs tend to have larger effects--and assess the power gained from using a Bayesian approach that does not make this assumption. Within the Bayesian framework, we find that good approximations to a full analysis can be achieved by simply replacing unknown genotypes with a point estimate--their posterior mean. This approximation considerably reduces computational expense compared with published sampling-based approaches, and the methods we present are practical on a genome-wide scale with very modest computational resources (e.g., a single desktop computer). The approximation also facilitates combining information across studies, using only summary data for each SNP. Methods discussed here are implemented in the software package BIMBAM, which is available from http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html.},

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Genotype calling from high-throughput platforms such as Illumina and Affymetrix is a critical step in data processing, so that accurate information on genetic variants can be obtained for phenotype-genotype association studies. A number of algorithms have been developed to infer genotypes from data generated through the Illumina BeadStation platform, including GenCall, GenoSNP, Illuminus and CRLMM. Most of these algorithms are built on population-based statistical models to genotype every SNP in turn, such as GenCall with the GenTrain clustering algorithm, and require a large reference population to perform well. These approaches may not work well for rare variants where only a small proportion of the individuals carry the variant. A fundamentally different approach, implemented in GenoSNP, adopts a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based model to infer genotypes of all the SNPs in one individual, making it an appealing alternative to call rare variants. However, compared to the population-based strategies, more SNPs in GenoSNP may fail the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test. To take advantage of both strategies, we propose a two-stage SNP calling procedure, named the modified mixture model (M(3)), to improve call accuracy for both common and rare variants. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through applications to genotype calling on a set of HapMap samples used for quality control purpose in a large case-control study of cocaine dependence. The increase in power with M(3) is greater for rare variants than for common variants depending on the model.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale genotyping relies on the use of unsupervised automated calling algorithms to assign genotypes to hybridization data. A number of such calling algorithms have been recently established for the Affymetrix GeneChip genotyping technology. Here, we present a fast and accurate genotype calling algorithm for the Illumina BeadArray genotyping platforms. As the technology moves towards assaying millions of genetic polymorphisms simultaneously, there is a need for an integrated and easy-to-use software for calling genotypes.

RESULTS: We have introduced a model-based genotype calling algorithm which does not rely on having prior training data or require computationally intensive procedures. The algorithm can assign genotypes to hybridization data from thousands of individuals simultaneously and pools information across multiple individuals to improve the calling. The method can accommodate variations in hybridization intensities which result in dramatic shifts of the position of the genotype clouds by identifying the optimal coordinates to initialize the algorithm. By incorporating the process of perturbation analysis, we can obtain a quality metric measuring the stability of the assigned genotype calls. We show that this quality metric can be used to identify SNPs with low call rates and accuracy.

AVAILABILITY: The C++ executable for the algorithm described here is available by request from the authors.},

abstract = {Gene expression measurements are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as the state of the cell, experimental conditions and variants in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27{\%} of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs in human than previously shown.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventionally, the first step in analyzing the large and high-dimensional data sets measured by microarrays is visual exploration. Dendrograms of hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps (SOMs), and multidimensional scaling have been used to visualize similarity relationships of data samples. We address two central properties of the methods: (i) Are the visualizations trustworthy, i.e., if two samples are visualized to be similar, are they really similar? (ii) The metric. The measure of similarity determines the result; we propose using a new learning metrics principle to derive a metric from interrelationships among data sets.

RESULTS: The trustworthiness of hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, and the self-organizing map were compared in visualizing similarity relationships among gene expression profiles. The self-organizing map was the best except that hierarchical clustering was the most trustworthy for the most similar profiles. Trustworthiness can be further increased by treating separately those genes for which the visualization is least trustworthy. We then proceed to improve the metric. The distance measure between the expression profiles is adjusted to measure differences relevant to functional classes of the genes. The genes for which the new metric is the most different from the usual correlation metric are listed and visualized with one of the visualization methods, the self-organizing map, computed in the new metric.

CONCLUSIONS: The conjecture from the methodological results is that the self-organizing map can be recommended to complement the usual hierarchical clustering for visualizing and exploring gene expression data. Discarding the least trustworthy samples and improving the metric still improves it.},

abstract = {Mild facial asymmetries are common in typical growth patterns. Therefore, detection of disordered facial growth patterns in individuals characterized by asymmetries is preferably accomplished by reference to the typical variation found in the general population rather than to some ideal of perfect symmetry, which rarely exists. This presents a challenge in developing an asymmetry assessment tool that is applicable, without modification, to detect both mild and severe facial asymmetries. In this paper we use concepts from geometric morphometrics to obtain robust and spatially-dense asymmetry assessments using a superimposition protocol for comparison of a face with its mirror image. Spatially-dense localization of asymmetries was achieved using an anthropometric mask consisting of uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks that were automatically indicated on 3D facial images. Robustness, in the sense of an unbiased analysis under increasing asymmetry, was ensured by an adaptive, robust, least-squares superimposition. The degree of overall asymmetry in an individual was scored using a root-mean-squared-error, and the proportion was scored using a novel relative significant asymmetry percentage. This protocol was applied to a database of 3D facial images from 359 young healthy individuals and three individuals with disordered facial growth. Typical asymmetry statistics were derived and were mainly located on, but not limited to, the lower two-thirds of the face in males and females. The asymmetry in males was more extensive and of a greater magnitude than in females. This protocol and proposed scoring of asymmetry with accompanying reference statistics will be useful for the detection and quantification of facial asymmetry in future studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although genetic factors contribute to the onset of heart failure (HF), no large-scale genome-wide investigation of HF risk has been published to date. We have investigated the association of 2,478,304 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with incident HF by meta-analyzing data from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eligible participants for these analyses were of European or African ancestry and free of clinical HF at baseline. Each study independently conducted genome-wide scans and imputed data to the approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HapMap. Within each study, Cox proportional hazards regression models provided age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the association between each variant and time to incident HF. Fixed-effect meta-analyses combined results for each single-nucleotide polymorphism from the 4 cohorts to produce an overall association estimate and P value. A genome-wide significance P value threshold was set a priori at 5.0x10(-7). During a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 2526 incident HF events (12{\%}) occurred in 20 926 European-ancestry participants. The meta-analysis identified a genome-wide significant locus at chromosomal position 15q22 (1.4x10(-8)), which was 58.8 kb from USP3. Among 2895 African-ancestry participants, 466 incident HF events (16{\%}) occurred during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years. One genome-wide significant locus was identified at 12q14 (6.7x10(-8)), which was 6.3 kb from LRIG3.

CONCLUSIONS: We identified 2 loci that were associated with incident HF and exceeded genome-wide significance. The findings merit replication in other community-based settings of incident HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prognosis and survival are significant concerns for individuals with heart failure (HF). To better understand the pathophysiology of HF prognosis, the association between 2,366,858 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and all-cause mortality was evaluated among individuals with incident HF from 4 community-based prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were 2526 individuals of European ancestry and 466 individuals of African ancestry who experienced an incident HF event during follow-up in the respective cohorts. Within each study, the association between genetic variants and time to mortality among individuals with HF was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models that included adjustment for sex and age at the time of the HF event. Prospective fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted for the 4 study populations of European ancestry (N=1645 deaths) and for the 2 populations of African ancestry (N=281 deaths). Genome-wide significance was set at P=5.0x10(-7). Meta-analytic findings among individuals of European ancestry revealed 1 genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 3p22 in an intron of CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 7 (CMTM7, P=3.2x10(-7)). Eight additional loci in individuals of European ancestry and 4 loci in individuals of African ancestry were identified by high-signal SNPs (P{\textless}1.0x10(-5)) but did not meet genome-wide significance.

CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel locus associated with all-cause mortality among individuals of European ancestry with HF. This finding warrants additional investigation, including replication, in other studies of HF.},

abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P {\textless} 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10{\%} of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16{\%} of phenotypic variation (approximately 20{\%} of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

abstract = {Human facial diversity is substantial, complex, and largely scientifically unexplained. We used spatially dense quasi-landmarks to measure face shape in population samples with mixed West African and European ancestry from three locations (United States, Brazil, and Cape Verde). Using bootstrapped response-based imputation modeling (BRIM), we uncover the relationships between facial variation and the effects of sex, genomic ancestry, and a subset of craniofacial candidate genes. The facial effects of these variables are summarized as response-based imputed predictor (RIP) variables, which are validated using self-reported sex, genomic ancestry, and observer-based facial ratings (femininity and proportional ancestry) and judgments (sex and population group). By jointly modeling sex, genomic ancestry, and genotype, the independent effects of particular alleles on facial features can be uncovered. Results on a set of 20 genes showing significant effects on facial features provide support for this approach as a novel means to identify genes affecting normal-range facial features and for approximating the appearance of a face from genetic markers.},

abstract = {There is evidence across several species for genetic control of phenotypic variation of complex traits, such that the variance among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype), is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7{\%}, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA methylation. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants, including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes greater than 100,000.},

In a genome-wide search for loci associated with the upper versus the lower 5th percentiles of body mass index, height and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as clinical classes of obesity, including up to 263,407 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 4 new loci (IGFBP4, H6PD, RSRC1 and PPP2R2A) influencing height detected in the distribution tails and 7 new loci (HNF4G, RPTOR, GNAT2, MRPS33P4, ADCY9, HS6ST3 and ZZZ3) for clinical classes of obesity. Further, we find a large overlap in genetic structure and the distribution of variants between traits based on extremes and the general population and little etiological heterogeneity between obesity subgroups.},

abstract = {There is evidence across several species for genetic control of phenotypic variation of complex traits, such that the variance among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype), is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7{\%}, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA methylation. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants, including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes greater than 100,000.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15{\%}-20{\%} lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are set to become the method of choice for uncovering the genetic basis of human diseases. A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population. These panel selection strategies become harder to apply and interpret as sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project produce larger and more diverse reference sets, which led us to develop an alternative framework. Our approach is built around a new approximation that uses local sequence similarity to choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype in each region of the genome. This approximation makes it computationally efficient to use all available reference haplotypes, which allows us to bypass the panel selection step and to improve accuracy at low-frequency variants by capturing unexpected allele sharing among populations. Using data from HapMap 3, we show that our framework produces accurate results in a wide range of human populations. We also use data from the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) to provide recommendations for imputation-based studies in Africa. We demonstrate that our approximation improves efficiency in large, sequence-based reference panels, and we discuss general computational strategies for modern reference datasets. Genome-wide association studies will soon be able to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and our work provides a practical way for investigators to use this rich information. New methodology from this study is implemented in the IMPUTE2 software package.},

abstract = {Barbamide was extracted from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula strain 19L as a chlorinated lipopeptide for its potent molluscicidal activity. Precursor incorporation studies indicated that it is derived from acetate, l-phenylalanine, l-leucine and l-cysteine. The gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of barbamide (bar) was cloned and characterized in this study. DNA sequence analysis of cosmid pLM49 revealed a cluster of 12 open reading frames (barA–barK) extending 26 kb including the expected polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules and tailoring genes. The genetic architecture and domain organization of the bar cluster supports the assignment based on the apparent co-linearity of the systems. The activity assay of adenylation domains of barD (AD), barE (AE) and barG (AG2 for module 2) in an amino acid-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange experiment supports the conclusion that barbamide is synthesized from acetate, l-phenylalanine, l-cysteine and l-leucine with trichloroleucine as a direct precursor by a mixed polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetase. Assembly of barbamide includes unique biochemical mechanisms for chlorination, one-carbon truncation during chain elongation, E-double bond formation and thiazole ring formation.},

@article{LAMBALOT1996,
abstract = {Background: All polyketide syntheses, fatty acid synthases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases require posttranslational modification of their constituent acyl carrier protein domain(s) to become catalytically active. The inactive apoproteins are converted to. their active hole-forms by positranslational transfer of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) moiety of coenzyme A to the sidechain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue in each acyl carrier protein domain. The first P-pant transferase to be cloned and characterized was the recently reported Escherichia coli enzyme ACPS, responsible for ape to holo conversion of fatty acid synthase. Surprisingly, initial searches of sequence databases did not reveal any proteins with significant peptide sequence similarity with ACPS. Results: Through refinement of sequence alignments that indicated low level similarity with the ACPS peptide sequence, we identified two consensus motifs shared among several potential ACPS homologs. This has led to the identification of a large family of proteins having 12–22 {\%} similarity with ACPS, which are putative P-pant transferases. Three of these proteins, E. coli EntD and o195, and B. subtilis Sfp, have been overproduced, purified and found to have P-pant transferase activity, confirming that the observed low level of sequence homology correctly predicted catalytic function. Three P-pant transferases are now known to be present in E. coli (ACPS, EntD and o195); ACPS and EntD are specific for the activation of fatty acid synthase and enterobactin synthetase, respectively. The ape-protein substrate for o195 has not yet been identified. Sfp is responsible for the activation of the surfactin synthetase. Conclusions: The specificity of ACPS and EntD for distinct P-pant-requiring enzymes suggests that each P-pant-requiring synthase has its own partner enzyme responsible for ape to holo activation of its acyl carrier domains. This is the first direct evidence that in organisms containing multiple P-pant-requiring pathways, each pathway has its own posttranslational modifying activity.},

Biosynthesis proceeds by formation of linear peptidyl intermediates which may be enzymatically modified as well as transformed into specific cyclic structures. The respective enzyme systems are constructed of biosynthetic modules integrated into multienzyme structures. Genetic and DNA-sequence analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters have revealed extensive similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, conserved principles of organisation, and a unique mechanism of transport of intermediates during elongation and modification steps involving 4'-phospho-pantetheine. These similarities permit the identification of peptide synthetases and related aminoacyl-ligases and acyl-ligases from sequence data. Similarities to other biosynthetic systems involved in the assembly of polyketide metabolites are discussed.},

@article{Reverchon2002,
abstract = {In the plant-pathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi production of pectate lyases, the main virulence determinant, is modulated by a complex network involving several regulatory proteins. One of these regulators, PecS, also controls the synthesis of a blue pigment identified as indigoidine. Since production of this pigment is cryptic in the wild-type strain, E. chrysanthemi ind mutants deficient in indigoidine synthesis were isolated by screening a library of Tn5-B21 insertions in a pecS mutant. These ind mutations were localized close to the regulatory pecS-pecM locus, immediately downstream of pecM. Sequence analysis of this DNA region revealed three open reading frames, indA, indB, and indC, involved in indigoidine biosynthesis. No specific function could be assigned to IndA. In contrast, IndB displays similarity to various phosphatases involved in antibiotic synthesis and IndC reveals significant homology with many nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). The IndC product contains an adenylation domain showing the signature sequence DAWCFGLI for glutamine recognition and an oxidation domain similar to that found in various thiazole-forming NRPS. These data suggest that glutamine is the precursor of indigoidine. We assume that indigoidine results from the condensation of two glutamine molecules that have been previously cyclized by intramolecular amide bond formation and then dehydrogenated. Expression of ind genes is strongly derepressed in the pecS background, indicating that PecS is the main regulator of this secondary metabolite synthesis. DNA band shift assays support a model whereby the PecS protein represses indA and indC expression by binding to indA and indC promoter regions. The regulatory link, via pecS, between indigoidine and virulence factor production led us to explore a potential role of indigoidine in E. chrysanthemi pathogenicity. Mutants impaired in indigoidine production were unable to cause systemic invasion of potted Saintpaulia ionantha. Moreover, indigoidine production conferred an increased resistance to oxidative stress, indicating that indigoidine may protect the bacteria against the reactive oxygen species generated during the plant defense response.},

abstract = {MceIJ is a two protein complex responsible for attachment of a C-glycosylated and linearized derivative of enterobactin, an iron scavenger (siderophore) and product of nonribosomal peptide synthetase machinery, to the C-terminal serine residue of microcin E492 (MccE492), an 84 aa ribosomal antibiotic peptide produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae RYC492. The MceIJ-catalyzed formation of the glycosyl ester linkage between MccE492 and the siderophore requires ATP and Mg(II) as cofactors. This work addresses the ATP utilization, mechanism of C-terminal carboxylate activation, and substrate scope of MceIJ. Formation of the ribosomal peptide-nonribosomal peptide linkage between the MccE492 C-terminal decapeptide and monoglycosylated enterobactin (MGE) requires cleavage of the alpha,beta bond of ATP and formation of a putative peptidyl-CO-AMP intermediate. Attack of the peptidyl-CO-AMP carbonyl by the deprotonated C4' hydroxyl of the glucose moiety forms a glycosyl ester linkage with release of AMP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the three cysteines and five histidines in MceI to alanines reveals that these residues are not required structurally or catalytically. MceIJ recognizes all glycosylated enterobactin derivatives formed by the MccE492 gene cluster members MceC ( C-glycosyltransferase) and MceD (esterase) in vitro and a MGE derivative lacking the C6' hydroxyl moiety. The protein complex also accepts and modifies the C-terminal decapeptide substrate fragments of the structurally related microcins H47, I47, and M. MccE492 C-terminal decapeptides bearing fluorescein and biotin moieties on the N-terminus are also substrates for MceIJ, which provides a route for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of enterobactin conjugates with peptide linkages.},

Activities that are induced include the development of genetic competence, sporulation, the synthesis of degradative enzymes, motility, and antibiotic production. The genes that function in these processes are activated during the transition from exponential to stationary phase and are controlled by mechanisms that operate primarily at the level of transcription initiation. One class of genes functions in the synthesis of special metabolites such as the peptide antibiotics tyrocidine and gramicidin S as well as the cyclic lipopeptide surfactin. These genes include the grs and tyc operons in Bacillus brevis, which encode gramicidin S synthetase and tyrocidine synthetase, respectively, and the srfA operon of Bacillus subtilis which encodes the enzymes of the surfactin synthetase complex. Peptide antibiotic biosynthesis genes are regulated by factors as diverse as the early sporulation gene product Spo0A, the transition-state regulator AbrB, and gene products (ComA, ComP, and ComQ) required for the initiation of the competence developmental pathway.},

abstract = {Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are molecules produced by microorganisms that have a broad spectrum of biological activities and pharmaceutical applications (e.g., antibiotic, immunomodulating, and antitumor activities). One particularity of the NRPs is the biodiversity of their monomers, extending far beyond the 20 proteogenic amino acid residues. Norine, a comprehensive database of NRPs, allowed us to review for the first time the main characteristics of the NRPs and especially their monomer biodiversity. Our analysis highlighted a significant similarity relationship between NRPs synthesized by bacteria and those isolated from metazoa, especially from sponges, supporting the hypothesis that some NRPs isolated from sponges are actually synthesized by symbiotic bacteria rather than by the sponges themselves. A comparison of peptide monomeric compositions as a function of biological activity showed that some monomers are specific to a class of activities. An analysis of the monomer compositions of peptide products predicted from genomic information (metagenomics and high-throughput genome sequencing) or of new peptides detected by mass spectrometry analysis applied to a culture supernatant can provide indications of the origin of a peptide and/or its biological activity.},

Genetic engineering of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in the daptomycin biosynthetic pathway was exploited for the biosynthesis of novel active antibiotics. lambda-Red-mediated recombination was used to exchange single or multiple modules in the DptBC subunit of the NRPS to modify the daptomycin cyclic peptide core. We combined module exchanges, NRPS subunit exchanges, inactivation of the tailoring enzyme glutamic acid 3-methyltransferase, and natural variations of the lipid tail to generate a library of novel lipopeptides, some of which were as active as daptomycin against Gram-positive bacteria. One compound was more potent against an Escherichia coli imp mutant that has increased outer membrane permeability.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac phenotypes, such as left ventricular (LV) mass, demonstrate high heritability although most genes associated with these complex traits remain unidentified. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have relied on conventional 2D cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) as the gold-standard for phenotyping. However this technique is insensitive to the regional variations in wall thickness which are often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and require large cohorts to reach significance. Here we test whether automated cardiac phenotyping using high spatial resolution CMR atlases can achieve improved precision for mapping wall thickness in healthy populations and whether smaller sample sizes are required compared to conventional methods. METHODS: LV short-axis cine images were acquired in 138 healthy volunteers using standard 2D imaging and 3D high spatial resolution CMR. A multi-atlas technique was used to segment and co-register each image. The agreement between methods for end-diastolic volume and mass was made using Bland-Altman analysis in 20 subjects. The 3D and 2D segmentations of the LV were compared to manual labeling by the proportion of concordant voxels (Dice coefficient) and the distances separating corresponding points. Parametric and nonparametric data were analysed with paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test respectively. Voxelwise power calculations used the interstudy variances of wall thickness. RESULTS: The 3D volumetric measurements showed no bias compared to 2D imaging. The segmented 3D images were more accurate than 2D images for defining the epicardium (Dice: 0.95 vs 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001; mean error 1.3 mm vs 2.2 mm, P {\textless} 0.001) and endocardium (Dice 0.95 vs 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001; mean error 1.1 mm vs 2.0 mm, P {\textless} 0.001). The 3D technique resulted in significant differences in wall thickness assessment at the base, septum and apex of the LV compared to 2D (P {\textless} 0.001). Fewer subjects were required for 3D imaging to detect a 1 mm difference in wall thickness (72 vs 56, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High spatial resolution CMR with automated phenotyping provides greater power for mapping wall thickness than conventional 2D imaging and enables a reduction in the sample size required for studies of environmental and genetic determinants of LV wall thickness.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli exhibits a wide range of lifestyles encompassing commensalism and various pathogenic behaviors which its highly dynamic genome contributes to develop. How environmental and host factors shape the genetic structure of E. coli strains remains, however, largely unknown. Following a previous study of E. coli genomic diversity, we investigated its diversity at the metabolic level by building and analyzing the genome-scale metabolic networks of 29 E. coli strains (8 commensal and 21 pathogenic strains, including 6 Shigella strains). Using a tailor-made reconstruction strategy, we significantly improved the completeness and accuracy of the metabolic networks over default automatic reconstruction processes. Among the 1,545 reactions forming E. coli panmetabolism, 885 reactions were common to all strains. This high proportion of core reactions (57{\%}) was found to be in sharp contrast to the low proportion (13{\%}) of core genes in the E. coli pangenome, suggesting less diversity of metabolic functions compared to that of all gene functions. Core reactions were significantly overrepresented among biosynthetic reactions compared to the more variable degradation processes. Differences between metabolic networks were found to follow E. coli phylogeny rather than pathogenic phenotypes, except for Shigella networks, which were significantly more distant from the others. This suggests that most metabolic changes in non-Shigella strains were not driven by their pathogenic phenotypes. Using a supervised method, we were yet able to identify small sets of reactions related to pathogenicity or commensalism. The quality of our reconstructed networks also makes them reliable bases for building metabolic models.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

abstract = {During the past decade, mutations affecting liability to human disease have been discovered at a phenomenal rate, and that rate is increasing. For the most part, however, those diseases have a relatively simple genetic basis. For diseases with a complex genetic and environmental basis, new approaches are needed to pave the way for more rapid discovery of genes affecting liability. One such approach exploits large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population heterogeneity can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We describe a method called genomic control (GC), which obviates many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. Two such approaches are now available. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generate "overdispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The other approach, called Structured Association (SA), assumes that the sampled population, while heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, SA probabilistically assigns sampled individuals to these latent subpopulations. We review in detail the overdispersion GC. In addition to outlining the published ideas on this method, we describe several extensions: quantitative trait studies and case-control studies with haplotypes and multiallelic markers. For each study design our goal is to achieve control similar to that obtained for a family-based study, but with the convenience found in a population-based design.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite major advances in its diagnosis and treatment, gastric cancer (GC) remains a major life-threatening disease. Treatment of the disease is further aggravated by the lack of diagnostic biomarkers that can aid in the early detection of GC and promote its favorable prognosis. The present work aims to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for GC.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The present work is a case-control study that focuses on proteomic analysis of serum from healthy volunteers and GC patients using ClinProt profiling technology based on mass spectrometry. A pattern of proteins/peptides with the ability to differentiate the studied populations was identified. Deregulated proteins/peptides differentially expressed in the serum of patients compared with healthy volunteers were identified by mass spectroscopy.

RESULTS: A pattern of proteins/peptides consisting of four protein/peptide peaks at m/z 1467, 1867, 2701, and 2094 was identified. These protein/peptide peaks were able to differentiate the studied populations with close to 100{\%} sensitivity and specificity. Three of the deregulated proteins/peptides at m/z 1867, 2701, and 2094 were identified by mass spectroscopy (LTQ Orbitrap XL) as tubulin beta chain, thymosin beta-4-like protein 3, and cytochrome b-c₁ complex subunit 1, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of proteins/peptides identified in the present work shows great potential for GC diagnosis. Deregulated proteins of tubulin beta chain, thymosin beta-4-like protein 3, and cytochrome b-c₁ complex subunit 1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of GC and serve as potential serological diagnostic biomarkers.},

Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of association studies. The consequences of population structure on association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well, it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power.

abstract = {Too many reports of associations between genetic variants and common cancer sites and other complex diseases are false positives. A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below .05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or "noteworthy." We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators--that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.},

abstract = {Oryzias latipes (medaka) has been established as a vertebrate genetic model for over a century, and has recently been rediscovered outside its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to reinvigorate medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic panel derived from a single wild population. Here we characterize the genomes of wild medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental population structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties suitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will be feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of these medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern medaka population since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that the Southern Japanese medaka existed as a larger older population which went through a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population. These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu medaka samples is suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced. Progress of this project can be tracked at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/birney-srv/medaka-ref-panel.},

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci--e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

abstract = {The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5{\%} family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 x 10(-8). To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.},

abstract = {A host of data on genetic variation from the Human Genome and International HapMap projects, and advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies, have made genome-wide association (GWA) studies technically feasible. GWA studies help in the discovery and quantification of the genetic components of disease risks, many of which have not been unveiled before and have opened a new avenue to understanding disease, treatment, and prevention. This chapter presents an overview of GWA, an important tool for discovering regions of the genome that harbor common genetic variants to confer susceptibility for various diseases or health outcomes in the post-Human Genome Project era. A tutorial on how to conduct a GWA study and some practical challenges specifically related to the GWA design is presented, followed by a detailed GWA case study involving the identification of loci associated with glioma as an example and an illustration of current technologies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association (GWA) studies use high-throughput genotyping technologies to assay hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and relate them to clinical conditions and measurable traits. Since 2005, nearly 100 loci for as many as 40 common diseases and traits have been identified and replicated in GWA studies, many in genes not previously suspected of having a role in the disease under study, and some in genomic regions containing no known genes. GWA studies are an important advance in discovering genetic variants influencing disease but also have important limitations, including their potential for false-positive and false-negative results and for biases related to selection of study participants and genotyping errors. Although these studies are clearly many steps removed from actual clinical use, and specific applications of GWA findings in prevention and treatment are actively being pursued, at present these studies mainly represent a valuable discovery tool for examining genomic function and clarifying pathophysiologic mechanisms. This article describes the design, interpretation, application, and limitations of GWA studies for clinicians and scientists for whom this evolving science may have great relevance.},

@article{Johnson2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is growing rapidly leading to the discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Combining results from multiple GWAS datasets may potentially strengthen previous conclusions and suggest new disease loci, pathways or pleiotropic genes. However, no database or centralized resource currently exists that contains anywhere near the full scope of GWAS results.

METHODS: We collected available results from 118 GWAS articles into a database of 56,411 significant SNP-phenotype associations and accompanying information, making this database freely available here. In doing so, we met and describe here a number of challenges to creating an open access database of GWAS results. Through preliminary analyses and characterization of available GWAS, we demonstrate the potential to gain new insights by querying a database across GWAS.

RESULTS: Using a genomic bin-based density analysis to search for highly associated regions of the genome, positive control loci (e.g., MHC loci) were detected with high sensitivity. Likewise, an analysis of highly repeated SNPs across GWAS identified replicated loci (e.g., APOE, LPL). At the same time we identified novel, highly suggestive loci for a variety of traits that did not meet genome-wide significant thresholds in prior analyses, in some cases with strong support from the primary medical genetics literature (SLC16A7, CSMD1, OAS1), suggesting these genes merit further study. Additional adjustment for linkage disequilibrium within most regions with a high density of GWAS associations did not materially alter our findings. Having a centralized database with standardized gene annotation also allowed us to examine the representation of functional gene categories (gene ontologies) containing one or more associations among top GWAS results. Genes relating to cell adhesion functions were highly over-represented among significant associations (p {\textless} 4.6 x 10(-14)), a finding which was not perturbed by a sensitivity analysis.

CONCLUSION: We provide access to a full gene-annotated GWAS database which could be used for further querying, analyses or integration with other genomic information. We make a number of general observations. Of reported associated SNPs, 40{\%} lie within the boundaries of a RefSeq gene and 68{\%} are within 60 kb of one, indicating a bias toward gene-centricity in the findings. We found considerable heterogeneity in information available from GWAS suggesting the wider community could benefit from standardization and centralization of results reporting.},

abstract = {The syncytium of cardiomyocytes in the heart is tethered within a matrix composed principally of type I fibrillar collagen. The matrix has diverse mechanical functions that ensure the optimal contractile efficiency of this muscular pump. In the diseased heart, cardiomyocytes are lost to necrotic cell death, and phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells-termed 'myofibroblasts'-are activated to initiate a 'reparative' fibrosis. The structural integrity of the myocardium is preserved by this scar tissue, although at the expense of its remodelled architecture, which has increased tissue stiffness and propensity to arrhythmias. A persisting population of activated myofibroblasts turns this fibrous tissue into a living 'secretome' that generates angiotensin II and its type 1 receptor, and fibrogenic growth factors (such as transforming growth factor-$\beta$), all of which collectively act as a signal-transducer-effector signalling pathway to type I collagen synthesis and, therefore, fibrosis. Persistent myofibroblasts, and the resultant fibrous tissue they produce, cause progressive adverse myocardial remodelling, a pathological hallmark of the failing heart irrespective of its etiologic origin. Herein, we review relevant cellular, subcellular, and molecular mechanisms integral to cardiac fibrosis and consequent remodelling of atria and ventricles with a heterogeneity in cardiomyocyte size. Signalling pathways that antagonize collagen fibrillogenesis provide novel strategies for cardioprotection.},

A wide range of triggers, signaling pathways and potential end-effector mechanisms have been identified, which appear common to all forms of conditioning. Interestingly, conditioning applies to not only the cardiac myocyte, but to all the constitutive cell types within the myocardium. As our understanding of conditioning mechanisms continue to develop and we start to realise some of the difficulties in translating these phenomena to clinical treatments, it may be time to take a more integrative approach to conditioning, considering the many cellular and tissue types within the heart, and how they contribute to cytoprotective adaptations. In this review, we shall look at the conditioning phenomena, how different cell types contribute to the conditioned phenotype, and where novel cardioprotective modalities may be developed.},

This has led to two emerging paradigms in SC biology: the application of developmental biology studies and the manipulation of the SC niche. Developmental studies can reveal how SCs are orchestrated to build organs, the understanding of which is important in order to instigate tissue repair in the adult. SC niche studies can reveal cues that maintain SC 'stemness' and how SCs may be released from the constraints of the niche to differentiate and repopulate a 'failing' organ. The haematopoietic system provides an exemplar whereby characterisation of the blood lineages during development and the bone marrow niche has resulted in therapeutics now routinely used in the clinic. Ischaemic heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and the question remains as to whether these principles can be applied to the heart, in order to exploit the potential of adult SCs for use in cardiovascular repair and regeneration.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common familial heart disease with vast genetic heterogeneity, demonstrated over the past 20 years. Mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere ({\textgreater}1,400 variants) are responsible for (or associated with) HCM. Explosive progress achieved in understanding the rapidly evolving science underlying HCM genomics has resulted in fee-for-service testing, making genetic information widely available. The power of HCM mutational analysis, albeit a more limited role than initially envisioned, lies most prominently in screening family members at risk for developing disease and excluding unaffected relatives, which is information not achievable otherwise. Genetic testing also allows expansion of the broad HCM disease spectrum and diagnosis of HCM phenocopies with different natural history and treatment options, but is not a reliable strategy for predicting prognosis. Interfacing a heterogeneous disease such as HCM with the vast genetic variability of the human genome, and high frequency of novel mutations, has created unforeseen difficulties in translating complex science (and language) into the clinical arena. Indeed, proband diagnostic testing is often expressed on a probabilistic scale, which is frequently incompatible with clinical decision making. Major challenges rest with making reliable distinctions between pathogenic mutations and benign variants, and those judged to be of uncertain significance. Genotyping in HCM can be a powerful tool for family screening and diagnosis. However, wider adoption and future success of genetic testing in the practicing cardiovascular community depends on a standardized approach to mutation interpretation, and bridging the communication gap between basic scientists and clinicians.},

abstract = {Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits. Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms.},

abstract = {Unraveling the molecular processes that lead from genotype to phenotype is crucial for the understanding and effective treatment of genetic diseases. Knowledge of the causative genetic defect most often does not enable treatment; therefore, causal intermediates between genotype and phenotype constitute valuable candidates for molecular intervention points that can be therapeutically targeted. Mapping genetic determinants of gene expression levels (also known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTL studies) is frequently used for this purpose, yet distinguishing causation from correlation remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this challenge using extensive, multi-environment gene expression and fitness profiling of hundreds of genetically diverse yeast strains, in order to identify truly causal intermediate genes that condition fitness in a given environment. Using functional genomics assays, we show that the predictive power of eQTL studies for inferring causal intermediate genes is poor unless performed across multiple environments. Surprisingly, although the effects of genotype on fitness depended strongly on environment, causal intermediates could be most reliably predicted from genetic effects on expression present in all environments. Our results indicate a mechanism explaining this apparent paradox, whereby immediate molecular consequences of genetic variation are shared across environments, and environment-dependent phenotypic effects result from downstream integration of environmental signals. We developed a statistical model to predict causal intermediates that leverages this insight, yielding over 400 transcripts, for the majority of which we experimentally validated their role in conditioning fitness. Our findings have implications for the design and analysis of clinical omics studies aimed at discovering personalized targets for molecular intervention, suggesting that inferring causation in a single cellular context can benefit from molecular profiling in multiple contexts.},

We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

abstract = {We compare and contrast the genetic architecture of quantitative phenotypes in two genetically well-characterized model organisms, the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, with that found in our own species from recent successes in genome-wide association studies. We show that the current model of large numbers of loci, each of small effect, is true for all species examined, and that discrepancies can be largely explained by differences in the experimental designs used. We argue that the distribution of effect size of common variants is the same for all phenotypes regardless of species, and we discuss the importance of epistasis, pleiotropy, and gene by environment interactions. Despite substantial advances in mapping quantitative trait loci, the identification of the quantitative trait genes and ultimately the sequence variants has proved more difficult, so that our information on the molecular basis of quantitative variation remains limited. Nevertheless, available data indicate that many variants lie outside genes, presumably in regulatory regions of the genome, where they act by altering gene expression. As yet there are very few instances where homologous quantitative trait loci, or quantitative trait genes, have been identified in multiple species, but the availability of high-resolution mapping data will soon make it possible to test the degree of overlap between species.},

In this paper, we provide a protocol for a sequence-independent approach for cloning complex individual or combinatorial DNA libraries, and routine or high-throughput cloning of single or multiple DNA fragments. The strategy, called circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), is based on polymerase overlap extension and is therefore free of restriction digestion, ligation or single-stranded homologous recombination. CPEC is highly efficient, accurate and user friendly. Once the inserts and the linear vector have been prepared, the CPEC reaction can be completed in 10 min to 3 h, depending on the complexity of the gene libraries.},

abstract = {Proteins are under tight evolutionary constraints, so if a protein changes it can only do so in ways that do not compromise its function. In addition, the proteins in an organism evolve at different rates. Leveraging the history of patristic distance methods, a new method for analysing comparative protein evolution, called Mean Protein Evolutionary Distance (MeaPED), measures differential resistance to evolutionary pressure across viral proteomes and is thereby able to point to the proteins' roles. Different species' proteomes can also be compared because the results, consistent across virus subtypes, concisely reflect the very different lifestyles of the viruses. The MeaPED method is here applied to influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus, rotavirus A, polyomavirus BK and measles, which span the positive and negative single-stranded, doubled-stranded and reverse transcribing RNA viruses, and double-stranded DNA viruses. From this analysis, host interaction proteins including hemagglutinin (influenza), and viroporins agnoprotein (polyomavirus), p7 (hepatitis C) and VPU (HIV) emerge as evolutionary hot-spots. By contrast, RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins including L (measles), PB1/PB2 (influenza) and VP1 (rotavirus), and internal serine proteases such as NS3 (dengue and hepatitis C virus) emerge as evolutionary cold-spots. The hot spot influenza hemagglutinin protein is contrasted with the related cold spot H protein from measles. It is proposed that evolutionary cold-spot proteins can become significant targets for second-line anti-viral therapeutics, in cases where front-line vaccines are not available or have become ineffective due to mutations in the hot-spot, generally more antigenically exposed proteins. The MeaPED package is available from www.pam1.bcs.uwa.edu.au/{\~{}}michaelw/ftp/src/meaped.tar.gz.},

These are the SwissProt-,GenBank-, EMBL-, DSSP- PDB-, MSF-, and plain ASCII text format. The special feature of STRAP is the simple visualization of spatial distances C(alpha)-atoms within the alignment. Thus structural information can easily be incorporated into the sequence alignment and can guide the alignment process in cases of low sequence similarities. Further STRAP is able to manage huge alignments comprising a lot of sequences. The protein viewers and modeling programs INSIGHT, RASMOL and WEBMOL are embedded into STRAP. STRAP is written in JAVA: The well-documented source code can be adapted easily to special requirements. STRAP may become the basis for complex alignment tools in the future.},

Here, we describe the engineering of novel FN3 domains from two different proteins, namely human fibronectin and human tenascin-C, as potential alternative scaffold biotherapeutics. The resulting FN3 domains were found to be robustly expressed in Escherichia coli, soluble and highly stable, with melting temperatures of 89 and 78°C, respectively. X-ray crystallography was used to confirm that the consensus approach led to a structure consistent with the FN3 design despite having only low-sequence identity to natural FN3 domains. The ability of the Tenascin consensus domain to withstand mutations in the loop regions connecting the $\beta$-strands was investigated using alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrating the potential for randomization in these regions. Finally, rational design was used to produce point mutations that significantly increase the stability of one of the consensus domains. Together our data suggest that consensus FN3 domains have potential utility as alternative scaffold therapeutics.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Both alignment generation and visualization are important processes for producing biologically meaningful sequence alignments. Computational tools that combine reliable, automated and semi-automated approaches to produce secondary structure-based alignments with an appropriate visualization of the results are rare. We have developed SBAL, a tool to generate and edit secondary structure-based sequence alignments. It is easy to install and provides a user-friendly interface. Sequence alignments are displayed, with secondary structure assignments mapped to their corresponding regions in the sequence by using a simple colour scheme. The algorithm implemented for automated and semi-automated secondary structure-based alignment calculations shows a comparable performance to existing software.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SBAL has been implemented in Java to provide cross-platform compatibility. SBAL is freely available to academic users at http://www.structuralchemistry.org/pcsb/. Users will be asked for their name, institution and email address. A manual can also be downloaded from this site. The software, manual and test sets are also available as supplementary material.

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90{\%} of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

abstract = {Understanding intrathymic T cell differentiation has been greatly aided by the development of various reductionist in vitro models that mimic certain steps/microenvironments of this complex process. Most models focused on the faithful in vitro restoration of T cell differentiation and selection. In contrast, suitable in vitro models emulating the developmental pathways of the two major thymic epithelial cell lineages-cortical thymic epithelial cells and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs)-are yet to be developed. In this regard, lack of an in vitro model mimicking the developmental biology of the mTEC lineage has hampered the molecular analysis of the so-called "promiscuous expression" of tissue-restricted genes, a key property of terminally differentiated mTECs. Based on the close biological relationship between the skin and thymus epithelial cell compartments, we adapted a three-dimensional organotypic coculture model, originally developed to provide a bona fide in vitro dermal equivalent, for the culture of isolated mTECs. This three-dimensional model preserves key features of mTECs: proliferation and terminal differentiation of CD80(lo), Aire(-) mTECs into CD80(hi), Aire(+) mTECs; responsiveness to RANKL; and sustained expression of FoxN1, Aire, and tissue-restricted genes in CD80(hi) mTECs. This in vitro culture model should facilitate the identification of molecular components and pathways involved in mTEC differentiation in general and in promiscuous gene expression in particular.},

We analyzed the effect of CD as well as normalized distance (ND) using expression data in six eukaryotic species: yeast, fruit fly, worm, rat, mouse and human.},

abstract = {Expression of genes in eukaryotic genomes is known to cluster, but cluster size is generally loosely defined and highly variable. We have here taken a very strict definition of cluster as sets of physically adjacent genes that are highly coexpressed and form so-called local coexpression domains. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome was analyzed for the presence of such local coexpression domains to elucidate its functional characteristics. We used expression data sets that cover different experimental conditions, organs, tissues, and cells from the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing repository and microarray data (Affymetrix) from a detailed root analysis. With these expression data, we identified 689 and 1,481 local coexpression domains, respectively, consisting of two to four genes with a pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficient larger than 0.7. This number is approximately 1- to 5-fold higher than the numbers expected by chance. A small (5{\%}-10{\%}) yet significant fraction of genes in the Arabidopsis genome is therefore organized into local coexpression domains. These local coexpression domains were distributed over the genome. Genes in such local domains were for the major part not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). Neither tandemly duplicated genes nor shared promoter sequence nor gene distance explained the occurrence of coexpression of genes in such chromosomal domains. This indicates that other parameters in genes or gene positions are important to establish coexpression in local domains of Arabidopsis chromosomes.},

Here, we compared the expression profile of the casein gene locus in mTECs and mammary gland epithelial cells by single cell PCR. Mammary gland cells showed highly correlated intra- and interchromosomal coexpression of milk proteins (the casein genes, lactalbumin-alpha and whey acidic protein) and one of its transcriptional regulators (Elf5). In contrast, coexpression of these genes in mature CD80(hi) mTECs was rarely observed and no pattern of gene expression in individual mTECs was discernible. The apparent stochastic expression pattern of genes within the casein locus, the lower mRNA levels compared with mammary gland cells in conjunction with frequent coexpression of insulin in single mTECs clearly delineates the molecular mechanism(s) of promiscuous gene expression from cell lineage-specific gene control.},

Here we demonstrate that data from a single high-throughput DNase I hypersensitivity assay can delineate hundreds of thousands of base-pair resolution in vivo footprints in human cells that precisely mark individual transcription factor-DNA interactions. These annotations provide a unique resource for the investigation of cis-regulatory elements. We find that footprints for specific transcription factors correlate with ChIP-seq enrichment and can accurately identify functional versus nonfunctional transcription factor motifs. We also find that footprints reveal a unique evolutionary conservation pattern that differentiates functional footprinted bases from surrounding DNA. Finally, detailed analysis of CTCF footprints suggests multiple modes of binding and a novel DNA binding motif upstream of the primary binding site.},

abstract = {A major goal in genomics is to understand how genes are regulated in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis, using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000 tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified 14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites. Approximately 80{\%} of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes, CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and HeLa cells. However, approximately 10{\%} of the DNase HS sites are lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates cell function and fate.},

@article{Maclean2011,
abstract = {Histone H1 is an abundant and essential component of chromatin whose precise role in regulating gene expression is poorly understood. Here, we report that a major target of H1-mediated regulation in embryonic stem (ES) cells is the X-linked Rhox homeobox gene cluster. To address the underlying mechanism, we examined the founding member of the Rhox gene cluster-Rhox5-and found that its distal promoter (Pd) loses H1, undergoes demethylation, and is transcriptionally activated in response to loss of H1 genes in ES cells. Demethylation of the Pd is required for its transcriptional induction and we identified a single cytosine in the Pd that, when methylated, is sufficient to inhibit Pd transcription. Methylation of this single cytosine prevents the Pd from binding GA-binding protein (GABP), a transcription factor essential for Pd transcription. Thus, H1 silences Rhox5 transcription by promoting methylation of one of its promoters, a mechanism likely to extend to other H1-regulated Rhox genes, based on analysis of ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases. The Rhox cluster genes targeted for H1-mediated transcriptional repression are also subject to another DNA methylation-regulated process: Xp imprinting. Remarkably, we found that only H1-regulated Rhox genes are imprinted, not those immune to H1-mediated repression. Together, our results indicate that the Rhox gene cluster is a major target of H1-mediated transcriptional repression in ES cells and that H1 is a candidate to have a role in Xp imprinting.},

The self-tolerance in two families of rat insulin promoter (RIP)-Tag mice, expressing different levels of Tag protein, has been characterized. These mice have impaired antibody responses to Tag, show diminished Tag-specific T-cell proliferation, and evidence an inability to generate Tag-specific cytotoxic T cells. The existence of systemic tolerance toward a beta-cell-specific protein motivated examination of transgene expression in the thymus. Indeed, low levels of Tag mRNA were detected intrathymically. Remarkably, this expression is a valid property of the insulin gene regulatory region, since insulin RNA was also expressed in the thymus of nontransgenic mice. RNA for other pancreatic genes was also detected in the thymus, thus raising the possibility that many tissue-specific genes could be expressed intrathymically during immunological development and induction of self-tolerance. These results raise important questions for future research into the role of the thymus in tolerance induction toward so-called tissue-specific antigens.},

By contrast, when the same antigen enters the thymus via the blood stream, negative selection is strictly dependent on antigen presentation by hemopoietic cells.

Imprinting is a particularly important genetic mechanism in mammals, and is thought to influence the transfer of nutrients to the fetus and the newborn from the mother. Consistent with this view is the fact that imprinted genes tend to affect growth in the womb and behaviour after birth. Aberrant imprinting disturbs development and is the cause of various disease syndromes. The study of imprinting also provides new insights into epigenetic gene modification during development.},

abstract = {ChIP-Seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with ultra high-throughput massively parallel sequencing, is increasingly being used for mapping protein-DNA interactions in-vivo on a genome scale. Typically, short sequence reads from ChIP-Seq are mapped to a reference genome for further analysis. Although genomic regions enriched with mapped reads could be inferred as approximate binding regions, short read lengths (approximately 25-50 nt) pose challenges for determining the exact binding sites within these regions. Here, we present SISSRs (Site Identification from Short Sequence Reads), a novel algorithm for precise identification of binding sites from short reads generated from ChIP-Seq experiments. The sensitivity and specificity of SISSRs are demonstrated by applying it on ChIP-Seq data for three widely studied and well-characterized human transcription factors: CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1). We identified 26 814, 5813 and 73 956 binding sites for CTCF, NRSF and STAT1 proteins, respectively, which is 32, 299 and 78{\%} more than that inferred previously for the respective proteins. Motif analysis revealed that an overwhelming majority of the identified binding sites contained the previously established consensus binding sequence for the respective proteins, thus attesting for SISSRs' accuracy. SISSRs' sensitivity and precision facilitated further analyses of ChIP-Seq data revealing interesting insights, which we believe will serve as guidance for designing ChIP-Seq experiments to map in vivo protein-DNA interactions. We also show that tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein-DNA binding affinity, which could be used to distinguish and characterize strong and weak binding sites. Using tag density as an indicator of DNA-binding affinity, we have identified core residues within the NRSF and CTCF binding sites that are critical for a stronger DNA binding.},

abstract = {The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is a cis regulatory element that is located in the 5' part of the locus and confers high-level erythroid lineage-specific and position-independent expression of the globin genes. The LCR is composed of five DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs), four of which are formed in erythroid cells. The function of the 5'-most site, HS5, remains unknown. To gain insights into its function, mouse HS5 was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the HS5 sequences of mouse, human, and galago revealed two extensively conserved regions, designated HS5A and HS5B. DNase I hypersensitivity mapping revealed that two hypersensitive sites are located within the HS5A region (designated HS5A(major) and HS5A(minor)), and two are located within the HS5B region (HS5B(major), HS5B(minor)). The positions of each of these HSs colocalize with either GATA-1 or Ap1/NF-E2 motifs, suggesting that these protein binding sites are implicated in the formation of HS5. Gel retardation assays indicated that the Ap1/NF-E2 motifs identified in murine HS5A and HS5B interact with NF-E2 or similar proteins. Studies of primary murine cells showed that HS5 is formed in all hemopoietic tissues tested (fetal liver, adult thymus, and spleen), indicating that this HS is not erythroid lineage specific. HS5 was detected in murine brain but not in murine kidney or adult liver, suggesting that this site is not ubiquitous. The presence of GATA-1 and NF-E2 motifs (which are common features of the DNase I hypersensitive sites of the LCR) suggests that the HS5 is organized in a manner similar to that of the other HSs. Taken together, our results suggest that HS5 is an inherent component of the beta-globin locus control region.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.},

abstract = {Transcription in the eukaryotic nucleus has long been thought of as conforming to a model in which RNA polymerase complexes are recruited to and track along isolated templates. However, a more dynamic role for chromatin in transcriptional regulation is materializing: enhancer elements interact with promoters forming loops that often bridge considerable distances and genomic loci, even located on different chromosomes, undergo chromosomal associations. These associations amass to form an extensive 'transcriptional interactome', enacted at functional subnuclear compartments, to which genes dynamically relocate. The emerging view is that long-range chromosomal associations between genomic regions, and their repositioning in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, are key contributors to the regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is a gene where mutations cause the recessively inherited disorder called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) or autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS1). Variable combinations of autoimmune endocrine diseases such as Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism, and type 1 diabetes characterize APECED. The AIRE protein has several domains indicative of a transcriptional regulator. AIRE contains two PHD (plant homeodomain) type zinc fingers, four nuclear receptor binding LXXLL motifs, a putative DNA-binding domain named SAND and, in addition, a highly conserved N-terminal domain similar to the homogenously staining region domain of the Sp100 protein. At the subcellular level, AIRE is expressed in nuclear dots resembling promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, which are associated with several transcriptionally active proteins. AIRE is primarily expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells and monocyte-dendritic cells in the thymus but also in a rare subset of cells in the lymph nodes, spleen and fetal liver. The disease, caused by mutations in AIRE, its function as a protein involved in transcription, and its restricted expression in cells important in negative selection, all together suggest that AIRE is a central protein in the maintenance of immune tolerance. In this review of the recent literature we discuss the results of these studies with particular attention on the AIRE expression pattern and its function as a transcriptional regulator, as well as the effects of patient mutations on the molecular characteristics of the protein.},

We used aire- deficient mice to test the hypothesis that this transcription factor regulates autoimmunity by promoting the ectopic expression of peripheral tissue- restricted antigens in medullary epithelial cells of the thymus. This hypothesis proved correct. The mutant animals exhibited a defined profile of autoimmune diseases that depended on the absence of aire in stromal cells of the thymus. Aire-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells showed a specific reduction in ectopic transcription of genes encoding peripheral antigens. These findings highlight the importance of thymically imposed "central" tolerance in controlling autoimmunity.},

Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play a pivotal role in this process by virtue of promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted autoantigens. This brief review covers progress of the last two years in deciphering the functional interrelationship among TEC development, promiscuous gene expression, and central tolerance. We discuss new insights into signaling pathways directing the differentiation and homeostasis of mTECs, and new clues to the molecular regulation of promiscuous gene expression (pGE), including the role of the transcriptional regulator autoimmune regulator (AIRE). Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of promiscuous expression of particular tissue-restricted self-antigens in preventing organ-specific autoimmunity and evaluate new data supporting the threshold model of central tolerance.},

However, the phenomenon of promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens by medullary thymic epithelial cells has led to a reassessment of the role of central T-cell tolerance in preventing organ-specific autoimmunity. Recent evidence indicates that both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms account for this unorthodox mode of gene expression.

Chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes, having the second highest gene density in the genome. It is also enriched in segmental duplications, ranking third in density among the autosomes. Here we report a finished sequence for human chromosome 17, as well as a structural comparison with the finished sequence for mouse chromosome 11, the first finished mouse chromosome. Comparison of the orthologous regions reveals striking differences. In contrast to the typical pattern seen in mammalian evolution, the human sequence has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement, whereas the mouse sequence has been remarkably stable. Moreover, although the human sequence has a high density of segmental duplication, the mouse sequence has a very low density. Notably, these segmental duplications correspond closely to the sites of structural rearrangement, demonstrating a link between duplication and rearrangement. Examination of the main classes of duplicated segments provides insight into the dynamics underlying expansion of chromosome-specific, low-copy repeats in the human genome.},

abstract = {It is known that DNA repair is heterogeneous in human cells since open chromatin, active genes and their transcribed strands are preferentially repaired. It is thus expected that DNA repair is clustered in chromosomes with high gene density. We have employed a DNA repair inhibitor, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), to convert ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced excision repairable lesions to chromosomal breaks, to check for the existence of heterogeneity of repair at the chromosome level. Chromosome staining by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to analyze breakage in chromosomes with diverse gene densities. These chromosomes were identified by means of the CpG island distribution after FISH with a CpG island-rich probe isolated from total human genomic DNA. Thus, three chromosomes with very high gene density (numbers 1, 19 and 20) were compared with two chromosomes with very low gene density (numbers 4 and 18) for clastogenicity and sensitivity to co-treatment with Ara-C and EMS. Our data indicate that those chromosome with higher gene density are more sensitive to a combination treatment with Ara-C and EMS, indicating that the level of excision repair synthesis is higher in those chromosome. It is therefore concluded that DNA excision repair is preferentially directed to chromosomes with high gene density. The implications of this finding in human biomonitoring using FISH techniques are discussed.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted ring.},

abstract = {Coregulation of lymphoid-specific gene sets is achieved by a series of epigenetic mechanisms. Association with higher-order chromosomal structures (nuclear subcompartments repressing or favouring gene expression) and locus control regions affects recombination and transcription of clonotypic antigen receptors and expression of a series of other lymphoid-specific genes. Locus control regions can regulate DNA methylation patterns in their vicinity. They may induce tissue- and site-specific DNA demethylation and affect, thereby, accessibility to recombination-activating proteins, transcription factors, and enzymes involved in histone modifications. Both DNA methylation and the Polycomb group of proteins (PcG) function as alternative systems of epigenetic memory in lymphoid cells. Complexes of PcG proteins mark their target genes by covalent histone tail modifications and influence lymphoid development and rearrangement of IgH genes. Ectopic expression of protein noncoding microRNAs may affect the generation of B-lineage cells, too, by guiding effector complexes to sites of heterochromatin assembly. Coregulation of lymphoid and viral promoters is also possible. EBNA 2, a nuclear protein encoded by episomal Epstein-Barr virus genomes, binds to the cellular protein CBF1 (C promoter binding factor 1) and operates, thereby, a regulatory network to activate latent viral promoters and cellular promoters associated with CBF1 binding sites.},

This hypothesis proved correct. The mutant animals exhibited a defined profile of autoimmune diseases that depended on the absence of aire in stromal cells of the thymus. Aire-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells showed a specific reduction in ectopic transcription of genes encoding peripheral antigens.

abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.},

We find that genes with identical zip codes cluster together. This clustering was specific; pairs of genes that were targeted to the nuclear periphery by different zip codes did not cluster together. Insertion of two different zip codes (GRS I or GRS III) at an ectopic site induced clustering with endogenous genes that have that zip code. Targeting to the nuclear periphery and interaction with the nuclear pore is a prerequisite for gene clustering, but clustering can be maintained in the nucleoplasm. Finally, we find that the Put3 transcription factor recognizes the GRS I zip code to mediate both targeting to the NPC and interchromosomal clustering. These results suggest that zip-code-mediated clustering of genes at the nuclear periphery influences the three-dimensional arrangement of the yeast genome.},

The higher-order organization of genomes is functionally important for gene regulation and control of gene expression programs. Defects in how chromatin is globally organized are relevant for physiological and pathological processes. Mutations and transcriptional misregulation of several global genome organizers are linked to human diseases and global alterations in chromatin structure are emerging as key players in maintenance of genome stability, aging, and the formation of cancer translocations.},

abstract = {Nuclear bodies including nucleoli, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, Polycomb bodies, and paraspeckles are membraneless subnuclear organelles. They are present at steady-state and dynamically respond to basic physiological processes as well as to various forms of stress, altered metabolic conditions and alterations in cellular signaling. The formation of a specific nuclear body has been suggested to follow a stochastic or ordered assembly model. In addition, a seeding mechanism has been proposed to assemble, maintain, and regulate particular nuclear bodies. In coordination with noncoding RNAs, chromatin modifiers and other machineries, various nuclear bodies have been shown to sequester and modify proteins, process RNAs and assemble ribonucleoprotein complexes, as well as epigenetically regulate gene expression. Understanding the functional relationships between the 3D organization of the genome and nuclear bodies is essential to fully uncover the regulation of gene expression and its implications for human disease.},

abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are built from ∼30 different proteins called nucleoporins or Nups. Previous studies have shown that several Nups exhibit cell-type-specific expression and that mutations in NPC components result in tissue-specific diseases. Here we show that a specific change in NPC composition is required for both myogenic and neuronal differentiation. The transmembrane nucleoporin Nup210 is absent in proliferating myoblasts and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but becomes expressed and incorporated into NPCs during cell differentiation. Preventing Nup210 production by RNAi blocks myogenesis and the differentiation of ESCs into neuroprogenitors. We found that the addition of Nup210 to NPCs does not affect nuclear transport but is required for the induction of genes that are essential for cell differentiation. Our results identify a single change in NPC composition as an essential step in cell differentiation and establish a role for Nup210 in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is mediated by interactions between chromatin and protein complexes. The importance of where and when these interactions take place in the nucleus is currently a subject of intense investigation. Increasing evidence indicates that gene activation or silencing is often associated with repositioning of the locus relative to nuclear compartments and other genomic loci. At the same time, however, structural constraints impose limits on chromatin mobility. Understanding how the dynamic nature of the positioning of genetic material in the nuclear space and the higher-order architecture of the nucleus are integrated is therefore essential to our overall understanding of gene regulation.},

abstract = {Set1, the yeast histone H3-lysine 4 (H3-K4) methylase, is recruited by the Pol II elongation machinery to a highly localized domain at the 5' portion of active mRNA coding regions. Set1 association depends upon the TFIIH-associated kinase that phosphorylates the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) and mediates the transition between initiation and elongation, and Set1 interacts with the form of Pol II whose CTD is phosphorylated at serine 5 but not serine 2. The Rtf1 and Paf1 components of the Pol II-associated Paf1 complex are also important for Set1 recruitment. Although the level of dimethylated H3-K4 is fairly uniform throughout the genome, the pattern of trimethylated H3-K4 strongly correlates with Set1 occupancy. Hypermethylated H3-K4 within the mRNA coding region persists for considerable time after transcriptional inactivation and Set1 dissociation from the chromatin, indicating that H3-K4 hypermethylation provides a molecular memory of recent transcriptional activity.},

Histone H3 has been found to be di-methylated at lysine 4 (K4) in active euchromatic regions but not in silent heterochromatic sites. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1 protein can catalyse di- and tri-methylation of K4 and stimulate the activity of many genes. Using antibodies that discriminate between the di- and tri-methylated state of K4 we show that di-methylation occurs at both inactive and active euchromatic genes, whereas tri-methylation is present exclusively at active genes. It is therefore the presence of a tri-methylated K4 that defines an active state of gene expression. These findings establish the concept of methyl status as a determinant for gene activity and thus extend considerably the complexity of histone modifications.},

abstract = {The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

abstract = {An oligonucleosome 12-mer was reconstituted in the absence of linker histones, onto a DNA template consisting of 12 tandemly arranged 208-base pair fragments of the 5 S rRNA gene from the sea urchin Ly-techinus variegatus (Simpson, R. T., Thoma, F. S., and Burbaker, J. M. (1985) Cell 42, 799-808). The ionic strength-dependent folding of this nucleohistone complex was compared with that of a native oligonucleosome fraction obtained from chicken erythrocyte chromatin, which had been carefully stripped of linker histones and fractionated in sucrose gradients. The DNA of this native fraction exhibited a narrow size distribution centered around the length of the 208-12 DNA template used in the reconstituted complex. These two complexes displayed very similar hydrodynamic behavior as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. By combining these data with electron microscopy analysis, it was shown that the salt-dependent folding of oligonucleosomes in the absence of linker histones involves the bending of the linker DNA region connecting adjacent nucleosomes. It was also found that selective removal by trypsin of the N-terminal regions ("tails") of the core histones prevents the oligonucleosome chains from folding. Thus, in the absence of these histone domains, the bending of the linker DNA necessary to bring the nucleosomes in contact is completely abolished.

abstract = {Modulation of nucleosome stability in chromatin plays an important role in eukaryotic gene expression. The core histone N-terminal tail domains are believed to modulate the stability of wrapping nucleosomal DNA and the stability of the chromatin filament. We analyzed the contribution of the tail domains to the stability of nucleosomes containing selected DNA sequences that are intrinsically straight, curved, flexible, or inflexible. We find that the presence of the histone tail domains stabilizes nucleosomes containing DNA sequences that are intrinsically straight or curved. However, the tails do not significantly contribute to the free energy of nucleosome formation with flexible DNA. Interestingly, hyperacetylation of the core histone tail domains does not recapitulate the effect of tail removal by limited proteolysis with regard to nucleosome stability. We find that acetylation of the tails has the same minor effect on nucleosome stability for all the selected DNA sequences. A comparison of histone partitioning between long donor chromatin, acceptor DNA, and free histones in solution shows that the core histone tails mediate internucleosomal interactions within an H1-depleted chromatin fiber amounting to an average free energy of about 1 kcal/mol. Thus, such interactions would be significant with regard to the free energies of sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning. Last, we analyzed the contribution of the H2A/H2B dimers to nucleosome stability. We find that the intact nucleosome is stabilized by 900 cal/mol by the presence of the dimers regardless of sequence. The biological implications of these observations are discussed.},

abstract = {Chromatin, the physiological template of all eukaryotic genetic information, is subject to a diverse array of posttranslational modifications that largely impinge on histone amino termini, thereby regulating access to the underlying DNA. Distinct histone amino-terminal modifications can generate synergistic or antagonistic interaction affinities for chromatin-associated proteins, which in turn dictate dynamic transitions between transcriptionally active or transcriptionally silent chromatin states. The combinatorial nature of histone amino-terminal modifications thus reveals a "histone code" that considerably extends the information potential of the genetic code. We propose that this epigenetic marking system represents a fundamental regulatory mechanism that has an impact on most, if not all, chromatin-templated processes, with far-reaching consequences for cell fate decisions and both normal and pathological development.},

abstract = {Complex patterns of cell-type-specific gene expression are thought to be achieved by combinatorial binding of transcription factors (TFs) to sequence elements in regulatory regions. Predicting cell-type-specific expression in mammals has been hindered by the oftentimes unknown location of distal regulatory regions. To alleviate this bottleneck, we used DNase-seq data from 19 diverse human cell types to identify proximal and distal regulatory elements at genome-wide scale. Matched expression data allowed us to separate genes into classes of cell-type-specific up-regulated, down-regulated, and constitutively expressed genes. CG dinucleotide content and DNA accessibility in the promoters of these three classes of genes displayed substantial differences, highlighting the importance of including these aspects in modeling gene expression. We associated DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) with genes, and trained classifiers for different expression patterns. TF sequence motif matches in DHSs provided a strong performance improvement in predicting gene expression over the typical baseline approach of using proximal promoter sequences. In particular, we achieved competitive performance when discriminating up-regulated genes from different cell types or genes up- and down-regulated under the same conditions. We identified previously known and new candidate cell-type-specific regulators. The models generated testable predictions of activating or repressive functions of regulators. DNase I footprints for these regulators were indicative of their direct binding to DNA. In summary, we successfully used information of open chromatin obtained by a single assay, DNase-seq, to address the problem of predicting cell-type-specific gene expression in mammalian organisms directly from regulatory sequence.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

abstract = {Expression of eukaryotic genes with complex spatial-temporal regulation during development requires finer regulation than that of genes with simpler expression patterns. Given the high degree of conservation of the developmental gene set across distantly related phylogenetic taxa, it is argued that evolutionary variation has occurred by tweaking regulation of expression of developmental genes, rather than by changes in genes themselves. Complex regulation is often achieved through the coordinated action of transcription regulatory elements spread across the genome up to tens of kilobases from the promoters of their target genes. Disruption of regulatory elements has been implicated in several diseases and studies showing associations between disease traits and nonprotein coding variation hint for a role of regulatory elements as cause of diseases. Therefore, the identification and mapping of regulatory elements in genome scale is crucial to understand how gene expression is regulated, how organisms evolve, and to identify sequence variation causing diseases. Previously developed experimental techniques have been adapted to identify regulatory elements in genome scale and high-throughput, allowing a global view of their biological roles. We review methods as chromatin immunoprecipitation, DNase I hypersensitivity, and computational approaches and how they have been employed to generate maps of histone modifications, open chromatin, nucleosome positioning, and transcription factor binding regions in whole mammalian genomes. Given the importance of non-promoter elements in gene regulation and the recent explosion in the number of studies devoted to them, we focus on these elements and discuss the insights on gene regulation being obtained by these studies.},

abstract = {The structure and expression of genes encoding molecules homologous to mammalian T-cell receptors (TCR) have been recently studied in ectothermic vertebrate species representative of chondrychthians, teleosts, and amphibians. The overall TCR chain structure is well conserved in phylogeny: TCR beta- and TCR alpha-like chains were detected in all the species analyzed; TCR gamma- and TCR delta-like chains were also present in a chondrychthian species. The diversity potential of the variable (V) and joining (J) segments is rather large and, as in mammals, conserved diversity (D) segments are associated to the TCR beta and TCR delta chains. An important level of junctional diversity occurred at the V-(D)-J junctions, with the potential addition of N- and P-nucleotides. Thus, the conservation of the structure and of the potential of diversity of TCR molecules have been under a permanent selective pressure during vertebrate evolution. The structure of MHC class I and class II molecules was also well conserved in jawed vertebrates. TCR and MHC molecules are strongly functionally linked and play a determinant role in the initiation and the regulation of the specific immune responses; thus, it is not surprising that their structures have been reciprocally frozen during evolution.},

Adaptive immunity has evolved to provide a broader and more finely tuned repertoire of recognition for both self- and nonself-antigens. Adaptive immunity involves a tightly regulated interplay between antigen-presenting cells and T and B lymphocytes, which facilitate pathogen-specific immunologic effector pathways, generation of immunologic memory, and regulation of host immune homeostasis. Lymphocytes develop and are activated within a series of lymphoid organs comprising the lymphatic system. During development, sets of gene segments are rearranged and assembled to create genes encoding the specific antigen receptors of T and B lymphocytes. The rearrangement mechanism generates a tremendously diverse repertoire of receptor specificities capable of recognizing components of all potential pathogens. In addition to specificity, another principal feature of adaptive immunity is the generation of immunologic memory. During the first encounter with an antigen (pathogen), sets of long-lived memory T and B cells are established. In subsequent encounters with the same pathogen, the memory cells are quickly activated to yield a more rapid and robust protective response.},

Although CTCF has 11 zinc fingers, we show here that only 4 of these are essential to strong binding and that they recognize a core 12-bp DNA sequence common to most CTCF sites. By deleting individual fingers and mutating individual sites, we determined the orientation of binding. Furthermore, we were able to identify the specific finger and its point of DNA interaction that are responsible for the loss of CTCF binding when CpG residues are methylated in the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus.

abstract = {The cellular protooncogene MYC encodes a nuclear transcription factor that is involved in regulating important cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulated MYC expression appears critical to the development of various types of malignancies, and thus factors involved in regulating MYC expression may also play a key role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. We have cloned one such MYC regulatory factor, termed CTCF, which is a highly evolutionarily conserved-11-zinc finger transcriptional factor possessing multiple DNA sequence specificity. CTCF binds to a number of important regulatory regions within the 5' noncoding sequence of the human MYC oncogene, and it can regulate its transcription in several experimental systems. CTCF mRNA is expressed in cells of multiple different lineages. Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. Southern blot analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with normal human metaphase chromosomes showed that the human CTCF is a single-copy gene situated at chromosome locus 16q22. Cytogenetic studies have pointed out that chromosome abnormalities (deletions) at this locus frequently occur in many different human malignancies, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes in the region. To narrow down their localization, several loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of chromosome arm 16q in sporadic breast and prostate cancers have been carried out to define the most recurrent and smallest region(s) of overlap (SRO) for commonly deleted chromosome arm 16q material. For CTCF to be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene associated with tumorigenesis, it should localize within one of the SROs at 16q. Fine-mapping of CTCF has enabled us to assign the CTCF gene to about a 2 centiMorgan (cM) interval of 16q22.1 between the somatic cell hybrid breakpoints CY130(D) and CY4, which is between markers D16S186 (16AC16-101) and D16S496 (AFM214zg5). This relatively small region, containing the CTCF gene, overlaps the most frequently observed SROs for common chromosomal deletions found in sporadic breast and prostate tumors. In one of four analyzed paired DNA samples from primary breast cancer patients, we have detected a tumor-specific rearrangement of CTCF exons encoding the 11-zinc-finger domain. Therefore, taken together with other CTCF properties, localization of CTCF to a narrow cancer-associated chromosome region suggests that CTCF is a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene at 16q22.1.},

The binding of full-length CTCF generated a DNase I protected domain extending from position -78 to -116, which was interrupted by a hypersensitive site at position -99. Selective deletions from the N- and C-terminal sides of the zinc finger domain showed that the N-terminal end of the zinc finger domain was aligned toward the transcriptional start site.

abstract = {In mammals, a subset of genes inherit gametic marks that establish parent of origin-dependent expression patterns in the soma ([1] and references therein). The currently most extensively studied examples of this phenomenon, termed genomic imprinting, are the physically linked Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor II) and H19 genes, which are expressed mono-allelically from opposite parental alleles  1 and 2. The repressed status of the maternal Igf2 allele is due to cis elements that prevent the H19 enhancers [3] from accessing the Igf2 promoters on the maternal chromosome  4 and 5. A differentially methylated domain (DMD) in the 5′ flank of H19 is maintained paternally methylated and maternally unmethylated  6 and 7. We show here by gel-shift and chromatin immunopurification analyses that binding of the highly conserved multivalent factor CTCF ( 8 and 9 and references therein) to the H19 DMD is methylation-sensitive and parent of origin-dependent. Selectively mutating CTCF-contacting nucleotides, which were identified by methylation interference within the extended binding sites initially revealed by nuclease footprinting, abrogated the H19 DMD enhancer-blocking property. These observations suggest that molecular mechanisms of genomic imprinting may use an unusual ability of CTCF to interact with a diverse spectrum of variant target sites, some of which include CpGs that are responsible for methylation-sensitive CTCF binding in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {The DNA-binding protein CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) mediates enhancer blocking insulation at sites throughout the genome and plays an important role in regulating allele-specific expression at the Igf2/H19 locus and at other imprinted loci. Evidence is also accumulating that CTCF is involved in large scale organization of genomic chromatin. Although CTCF has 11 zinc fingers, we show here that only 4 of these are essential to strong binding and that they recognize a core 12-bp DNA sequence common to most CTCF sites. By deleting individual fingers and mutating individual sites, we determined the orientation of binding. Furthermore, we were able to identify the specific finger and its point of DNA interaction that are responsible for the loss of CTCF binding when CpG residues are methylated in the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus. This single interaction appears to be critical for allele-specific binding and insulation by CTCF.},

abstract = {The transcriptional repressor negative protein 1 (NeP1) binds specifically to the F1 element of the chicken lysozyme gene silencer and mediates synergistic repression by v-ERBA, thyroid hormone receptor, or retinoic acid receptor. Another protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), specifically binds to 50-bp-long sequences that contain repetitive CCCTC elements in the vicinity of vertebrate c-myc genes. Previously cloned chicken, mouse, and human CTCF cDNAs encode a highly conserved 11-Zn-finger protein. Here, NeP1 was purified and DNA bases critical for NeP1-F1 interaction were determined. NeP1 is found to bind a 50-bp stretch of nucleotides without any obvious sequence similarity to known CTCF binding sequences. Despite this remarkable difference, these two proteins are identical. They have the same molecular weight, and NeP1 contains peptide sequences which are identical to sequences in CTCF. Moreover, NeP1 and CTCF specifically recognize each other's binding DNA sequence and induce identical conformational alterations in the F1 DNA. Therefore, we propose to replace the name NeP1 with CTCF. To analyze the puzzling sequence divergence in CTCF binding sites, we studied the DNA binding of 12 CTCF deletions with serially truncated Zn fingers. While fingers 4 to 11 are indispensable for CTCF binding to the human c-myc P2 promoter site A, a completely different combination of fingers, namely, 1 to 8 or 5 to 11, was sufficient to bind the lysozyme silencer site F1. Thus, CTCF is a true multivalent factor with multiple repressive functions and multiple sequence specificities.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is a universal and ancient form of host defense against infection. Innate immune recognition relies on a limited number of germline-encoded receptors. These receptors evolved to recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not by the host. Recognition of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish infectious nonself from noninfectious self. Toll-like receptors play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Stimulation of Toll-like receptors by microbial products leads to the activation of signaling pathways that result in the induction of antimicrobial genes and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, stimulation of Toll-like receptors triggers dendritic cell maturation and results in the induction of costimulatory molecules and increased antigen-presenting capacity. Thus, microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors helps to direct adaptive immune responses to antigens derived from microbial pathogens.},

Studying each modification in five human cell lines including the ENCODE Consortium common cell lines GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) and HeLa-S3, as well as K562, HFL-1, and MOLT4, we identified clear patterns of histone modification profiles with respect to genomic features. H3K4me3, H3K4me2, and H3ac modifications are tightly associated with the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes, while H3K4me1 and H4ac have more widespread distributions. TSSs reveal characteristic patterns of both types of modification present and the position relative to TSSs. These patterns differ between active and inactive genes and in particular the state of H3K4me3 and H3ac modifications is highly predictive of gene activity. Away from TSSs, modification sites are enriched in H3K4me1 and relatively depleted in H3K4me3 and H3ac. Comparison between cell lines identified differences in the histone modification profiles associated with transcriptional differences between the cell lines.

abstract = {The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs-specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to approximately 20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes.},

abstract = {Chromosomes are the physical realization of genetic information and thus form the basis for its readout and propagation. Here we present a high-resolution chromosomal contact map derived from a modified genome-wide chromosome conformation capture approach applied to Drosophila embryonic nuclei. The data show that the entire genome is linearly partitioned into well-demarcated physical domains that overlap extensively with active and repressive epigenetic marks. Chromosomal contacts are hierarchically organized between domains. Global modeling of contact density and clustering of domains show that inactive domains are condensed and confined to their chromosomal territories, whereas active domains reach out of the territory to form remote intra- and interchromosomal contacts. Moreover, we systematically identify specific long-range intrachromosomal contacts between Polycomb-repressed domains. Together, these observations allow for quantitative prediction of the Drosophila chromosomal contact map, laying the foundation for detailed studies of chromosome structure and function in a genetically tractable system.},

@article{Spiro2012,
abstract = {The coordinated regulation of the expression of a group of genes by a specific transcription factor frequently lies at the heart of the ability of a bacterium to respond to an environmental signal, or to progress through a developmental program. Thus, in many situations, it is of interest to identify all of the genes that are under the control of a particular regulatory protein. This chapter begins with a brief overview of some of the methods that have been used in attempts to identify some or all of the members of a regulon (i.e., those genes that are the targets for a transcriptional activator or repressor). Thereafter, the chapter will focus on one technique, chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) and some of its variants. Design considerations and some protocols for ChIP-chip experiments are provided, along with some considerations related to downstream data analysis. ChIP-chip is a method for the genome-wide localization of protein-binding sites. In a typical ChIP-chip protocol, proteins are cross-linked nonspecifically to DNA in vivo. Chromatin is extracted and sheared, and specific protein-DNA complexes are immunoprecipitated with a suitable antibody. After purification, the DNA is hybridized to a microarray (after an amplification step in some protocols), together with a differentially labeled reference sample. Features on the microarray that show an elevated fluorescence ratio reveal DNA sequences that were enriched by immunoprecipitation. The corresponding genomic locations are those that were enriched, and are therefore close to sites of binding. The use of high-density tiled microarrays allows for binding site localization with quite high resolution. It is likely that ChIP-chip will soon be superseded by ChIP-seq, in which the immunoprecipitated DNA is analyzed directly by next-generation sequencing technologies. ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq applications are not confined to regulatory proteins, since they can be used with any protein that binds to DNA, either directly, or indirectly via an interaction with another protein. Thus, ChIP-chip has been used successfully to map binding sites for nucleoid proteins, and proteins involved in DNA replication.},

High-density oligonucleotide arrays offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale. Toward this end, we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes and have used them to profile a panel of 79 human and 61 mouse tissues. The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes, as well as known and poorly characterized genes, from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression, evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies, and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription. We describe hundreds of regions of correlated transcription and show that some are subject to both tissue and parental allele-specific expression, suggesting a link between spatial expression and imprinting.},

abstract = {We developed a quantitative methodology, digital analysis of chromatin structure (DACS), for high-throughput, automated mapping of DNase I-hypersensitive sites and associated cis-regulatory sequences in the human and other complex genomes. We used 19/20-bp genomic DNA tags to localize individual DNase I cutting events in nuclear chromatin and produced approximately 257,000 tags from erythroid cells. Tags were mapped to the human genome, and a quantitative algorithm was applied to discriminate statistically significant clusters of independent DNase I cutting events. We show that such clusters identify both known regulatory sequences and previously unrecognized functional elements across the genome. We used in silico simulation to demonstrate that DACS is capable of efficient and accurate localization of the majority of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the human genome without requiring an independent validation step. A unique feature of DACS is that it permits unbiased evaluation of the chromatin state of regulatory sequences from widely separated genomic loci. We found surprisingly large differences in the accessibility of distant regulatory sequences, suggesting the existence of a hierarchy of nuclear organization that escapes detection by conventional chromatin assays.},

Included in these methods are procedures for a second dimensional analysis of protein-protein cross-links in which the monomer components are electrophoretically resolved in the second dimension. The methods also include procedures to selectively reverse protein-DNA cross-links while maintaining the protein-protein cross-links. Potential artifacts are also discussed; i.e., data are presented which indicate that the helical pitch of DNA can be altered if the ionic strength is not properly controlled. The stability of the cross-linked nucleosome in the presence of altered pH or salt/urea concentrations is described in order to indicate that there are limitations to procedures that can be used for the subsequent characterization of the cross-linked complex.},

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

abstract = {Apoptosis (programmed cell death) can be difficult to detect in routine histological sections. Since extensive DNA fragmentation is an important characteristic of this process, visualization of DNA breaks could greatly facilitate the identification of apoptotic cells. We describe a new staining method for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections that involves an in situ end-labeling (ISEL) procedure. After protease treatment to permeate the tissue sections, biotinylated nucleotides are in situ incorporated into DNA breaks by polymerase and subsequently stained with DAB via peroxidase-conjugated avidin. Staining of cells with the morphological characteristics of apoptosis was demonstrated in tissues known to exhibit programmed cell death, i.e., prostate and uterus after castration, tumors, lymph node follicles, and embryos. Apoptotic cells could be discriminated morphologically from areas of labeled necrotic cells, in which DNA degradation also occurs. Because apoptosis is relatively easily recognized in H{\&}E-stained sections of involuting prostates of castrated rats, we used this model system to validate the ISEL method for the quantification of apoptotic cells. A high correlation was found between the fractions of ISEL-labeled cells and the fractions of apoptotic cells that were morphologically determined in adjacent sections. We conclude that ISEL is a useful technique for quantification of apoptosis in paraffin sections, especially for those tissues in which morphological determination is difficult. Furthermore, this new staining method enables the use of automated image cytometry for evaluating apoptosis.},

@article{Barrett2011,
abstract = {A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20,000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies. This paper describes recent database enhancements, including new search and data representation tools, as well as a brief review of how the community uses GEO data. GEO is freely accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.},

GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

abstract = {The abundance of Myc protein must be exquisitely controlled to avoid growth abnormalities caused by too much or too little Myc. An intriguing mode of regulation exists in which Myc protein itself leads to reduction in its abundance. We show here that dMyc binds to the miR-308 locus and increases its expression. Using our gain-of-function approach, we show that an increase in miR-308 causes a destabilization of dMyc mRNA and reduced dMyc protein levels. In vivo knockdown of miR-308 confirmed the regulation of dMyc levels in embryos. This regulatory loop is crucial for maintaining appropriate dMyc levels and normal development. Perturbation of the loop, either by elevated miR-308 or elevated dMyc, caused lethality. Combining elevated levels of both, therefore restoring balance between miR-308 and dMyc levels, resulted in lower apoptotic activity and suppression of lethality. These results reveal a sensitive feedback mechanism that is crucial to prevent the pathologies caused by abnormal levels of dMyc.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.},

@article{Cuddapah2009a,
abstract = {Insulators are DNA elements that prevent inappropriate interactions between the neighboring regions of the genome. They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

abstract = {Many animal and plant genomes are transcribed much more extensively than current annotations predict. However, the biological function of these unannotated transcribed regions is largely unknown. Approximately 7{\%} and 23{\%} of the detected transcribed nucleotides during D. melanogaster embryogenesis map to unannotated intergenic and intronic regions, respectively. Based on computational analysis of coordinated transcription, we conservatively estimate that 29{\%} of all unannotated transcribed sequences function as missed or alternative exons of well-characterized protein-coding genes. We estimate that 15.6{\%} of intergenic transcribed regions function as missed or alternative transcription start sites (TSS) used by 11.4{\%} of the expressed protein-coding genes. Identification of P element mutations within or near newly identified 5' exons provides a strategy for mapping previously uncharacterized mutations to their respective genes. Collectively, these data indicate that at least 85{\%} of the fly genome is transcribed and processed into mature transcripts representing at least 30{\%} of the fly genome.},

abstract = {Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.  Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.  Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

Thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell generation in vivo was directly correlated with in vitro TCR reactivity to OVA-peptide in a broad ∼1,000-fold range. Interestingly, higher TCR affinity was associated with a larger Treg cell developmental "niche" size, even though the amount of antigen should remain constant. The TCR-reactivity threshold to elicit thymic negative selection and peripheral T cell responses was ∼100-fold higher than that of Treg cell differentiation. Thus, these data suggest that the broad range of self-reactivity that elicits thymic Treg cell generation is tuned to secure peripheral tolerance to self.},

The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.},

Here, we describe the characteristics of the transcriptomes of two cultured cell lines, HB4a (normal breast epithelium) and HCT-116 (colon adenocarcinoma), using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS). We generated in excess of 10(7) short signature sequences per cell line, thus providing a comprehensive snapshot of gene expression, within the technical limitations of the method. The number of genes expressed at one copy per cell or more in either of the lines was estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000. The vast majority of the transcripts found in these cells can be mapped to known genes and their polyadenylation variants. Among the genes that could be identified from their signature sequences, approximately 8,500 were expressed by both cell lines, whereas 6,000 showed cellular specificity. Taking into account sequence tags that map uniquely to the genome but not to known transcripts, overall the data are consistent with an upper limit of 17,000 for the total number of genes expressed at more than one copy per cell in one or both of the two cell lines examined.},

We have identified several problems with the design of individual probes and we show the benefits of probe re-annotation on the analysis of BeadArray gene expression data sets. We discuss the importance of aspects such as probe coverage of individual transcripts, alternative messenger RNA splicing, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, repeat sequences, RNA degradation biases and probes targeting genomic regions with no known transcription. We conclude that many of the Illumina probes have unreliable original annotation and that our re-annotation allows analyses to focus on the good quality probes, which form the majority, and also to expand the scope of biological information that can be extracted.},

However, surprisingly little information is available about how these components are organized within the three-dimensional space of the nucleus. Technological advances are now helping to identify the spatial relationships and interactions of genes and regulatory elements in the nucleus and are revealing an unexpectedly extensive network of communication within and between chromosomes. A crucial unresolved issue is the extent to which this organization affects gene function, rather than just reflecting it.},

Regulation of sets of adjacent genes by mechanisms operating at the level of chromosomal domains has been demonstrated in a number of cases, but the fraction of genes in the genome subject to regulation at this level is unknown.RESULTS:Drosophila gene-expression profiles that were determined from over 80 experimental conditions using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays were searched for groups of adjacent genes that show similar expression profiles. We found about 200 groups of adjacent and similarly expressed genes, each having between 10 and 30 members; together these groups account for over 20{\%} of assayed genes. Each group covers between 20 and 200 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence, with a mean group size of about 100 kilobase pairs. Groups do not appear to show any correlation with polytene banding patterns or other known chromosomal structures, nor were genes within groups functionally related to one another.CONCLUSIONS:Groups of adjacent and co-regulated genes that are not otherwise functionally related in any obvious way can be identified by expression profiling in Drosophila. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not yet known.},

abstract = {An important strategy to study genome evolution is to investigate the clustering of orthologous genes among multiple genomes, in which the most popular approaches require that the distance between adjacent genes in a cluster be small. We investigate a different formulation based on constraining the overall size of a cluster and develop statistical significance estimates that allow direct comparison of clusters of different sizes. We first consider a restricted version which requires that orthologous genes are strictly ordered within each cluster and show that it can be solved in polynomial time. We then develop practical exact algorithms for the unrestricted problem that allows paralogous genes within a genome and clusters that may not appear in every genome while considering a general model in which a gene is allowed to appear in more than one orthologous group. We show that our algorithm can identify biologically relevant gene clusters on four bacterial genomes Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. We also show that our algorithm can identify significantly more functionally enriched gene clusters on four yeast genomes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus than previous algorithms.

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

abstract = {In prokaryotic genomes, related genes are frequently clustered in operons and higher-order arrangements that reflect functional context. Organization emerges despite rearrangements that constantly shuffle gene and operon order. Evidence is presented that the tandem duplication of related genes acts as a driving evolutionary force in the origin and maintenance of clusters. Gene amplification can be viewed as a dynamic and reversible regulatory mechanism that facilitates adaptation to variable environments. Clustered genes confer selective benefits via their ability to be coamplified. During evolution, rearrangements that bring together related genes can be selected if they increase the fitness of the organism in which they reside. Similarly, the benefits of gene amplification can prevent the dispersal of existing clusters. Examples of frequent and spontaneous amplification of large genomic fragments are provided. The possibility is raised that tandem gene duplication works in concert with horizontal gene transfer as interrelated evolutionary forces for gene clustering.},

However, it is still controversial to what extent this neighbor coexpression is maintained by selection and to what extent it is nonselective, purely mechanistic "leaky expression." Here, we analyze expression patterns of gene pairs that have lost their linkage in the evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae since its last common ancestor with Kluyveromyces waltii or that were never linked in the S. cerevisiae lineage but became neighbors in a related yeast. We demonstrate that coexpression of many linked genes is retained long after their separation and is thus likely to be functionally important. In addition, unlinked gene pairs that recently became neighbors in other yeast species tend to be coexpressed in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that natural selection often favors chromosomal rearrangements in which coexpressed genes become neighbors. Contrary to previous suggestions, selectively favorable coexpression appears not to be restricted to bidirectional promoters.},

abstract = {The alignment of full-length human cDNA sequences to the finished sequence of the human genome provides a unique opportunity to study the distribution of genes throughout the genome. By analyzing the distances between 23,752 genes, we identified a class of divergently transcribed gene pairs, representing more than 10{\%} of the genes in the genome, whose transcription start sites are separated by less than 1000 base pairs. Although this bidirectional arrangement has been previously described in humans and other species, the prevalence of bidirectional gene pairs in the human genome is striking, and the mechanisms of regulation of all but a few bidirectional genes are unknown. Our work shows that the transcripts of many bidirectional pairs are coexpressed, but some are antiregulated. Further, we show that many of the promoter segments between two bidirectional genes initiate transcription in both directions and contain shared elements that regulate both genes. We also show that the bidirectional arrangement is often conserved among mouse orthologs. These findings demonstrate that a bidirectional arrangement provides a unique mechanism of regulation for a significant number of mammalian genes.},

abstract = {Genes that belong to the same functional pathways are often packaged into operons in prokaryotes. However, aside from examples in nematode genomes, this form of transcriptional regulation appears to be absent in eukaryotes. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have shown that gene order in eukaryotic genomes is not completely random, and that genes with similar expression patterns tend to be clustered together. What remains unclear is whether co-expressed genes have been gathered together by natural selection to facilitate their regulation, or if the genes are co-expressed simply by virtue of their being close together in the genome. Here, we show that gene expression clusters tend to contain fewer chromosomal breakpoints between human and mouse than expected by chance, which indicates that they are being held together by natural selection. This conclusion applies to clusters defined on the basis of broad (housekeeping) expression, or on the basis of correlated transcription profiles across tissues. Contrary to previous reports, we find that genes with high expression are not clustered to a greater extent than expected by chance and are not conserved during evolution.},

abstract = {Chromosomes are divided into domains of open chromatin, where genes have the potential to be expressed, and domains of closed chromatin, where genes are not expressed. Classic examples of open chromatin domains include 'puffs' on polytene chromosomes in Drosophila and extended loops from lampbrush chromosomes. If multiple genes were typically expressed together from a single open chromatin domain, the position of co-expressed genes along the chromosomes would appear clustered. To investigate whether co-expressed genes are clustered, we examined the chromosomal positions of the genes expressed in the muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans at the first larval stage. Here we show that co-expressed genes in C. elegans are clustered in groups of 2-5 along the chromosomes, suggesting that expression from a chromatin domain can extend over several genes. These observations reveal a higher-order organization of the structure of the genome, in which the order of the genes along the chromosome id correlated with their expression in specific tissues.},

We mutagenized 19 regulatory elements that drive coexpression of Ciona muscle genes and obtained quantitative estimates of the cis-regulatory activity of the 77 motifs that comprise these elements. We found that individual motif activity ranges broadly within and among elements, and among different instantiations of the same motif type. The activity of orthologous motifs is strongly constrained, although motif arrangement, type, and activity vary greatly among the elements of different co-regulated genes. Thus, the syntactical rules governing this regulatory function are flexible but become highly constrained evolutionarily once they are established in a particular element.},

@article{Prieto2008,
abstract = {Background
Analysis of gene expression data using genome-wide microarrays is a technique often used in genomic studies to find coexpression patterns and locate groups of co-transcribed genes. However, most studies done at global “omic” scale are not focused on human samples and when they correspond to human very often include heterogeneous datasets, mixing normal with disease-altered samples. Moreover, the technical noise present in genome-wide expression microarrays is another well reported problem that many times is not addressed with robust statistical methods, and the estimation of errors in the data is not provided.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Human genome-wide expression data from a controlled set of normal-healthy tissues is used to build a confident human gene coexpression network avoiding both pathological and technical noise. To achieve this we describe a new method that combines several statistical and computational strategies: robust normalization and expression signal calculation; correlation coefficients obtained by parametric and non-parametric methods; random cross-validations; and estimation of the statistical accuracy and coverage of the data. All these methods provide a series of coexpression datasets where the level of error is measured and can be tuned. To define the errors, the rates of true positives are calculated by assignment to biological pathways. The results provide a confident human gene coexpression network that includes 3327 gene-nodes and 15841 coexpression-links and a comparative analysis shows good improvement over previously published datasets. Further functional analysis of a subset core network, validated by two independent methods, shows coherent biological modules that share common transcription factors. The network reveals a map of coexpression clusters organized in well defined functional constellations. Two major regions in this network correspond to genes involved in nuclear and mitochondrial metabolism and investigations on their functional assignment indicate that more than 60{\%} are house-keeping and essential genes. The network displays new non-described gene associations and it allows the placement in a functional context of some unknown non-assigned genes based on their interactions with known gene families.

Conclusions/Significance
The identification of stable and reliable human gene to gene coexpression networks is essential to unravel the interactions and functional correlations between human genes at an omic scale. This work contributes to this aim, and we are making available for the scientific community the validated human gene coexpression networks obtained, to allow further analyses on the network or on some specific gene associations.

Sharing of regulatory elements within the intergenic region of those adjacent gene pairs was often considered the major mechanism responsible for such co-expression. However, it is still in debate to what extent that common transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the co-expression of adjacent genes. In order to resolve the evolutionary aspect of this issue, we investigated the conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species. By using the information for TF binding sites in promoter regions available from the MYBS database http://cg1.iis.sinica.edu.tw/{\~{}}mybs/, the ratios of TF-sharing pairs among all the adjacent pairs in yeast genomes were analyzed.

abstract = {Expression of genes in eukaryotic genomes is known to cluster, but cluster size is generally loosely defined and highly variable. We have here taken a very strict definition of cluster as sets of physically adjacent genes that are highly coexpressed and form so-called local coexpression domains. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome was analyzed for the presence of such local coexpression domains to elucidate its functional characteristics. We used expression data sets that cover different experimental conditions, organs, tissues, and cells from the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing repository and microarray data (Affymetrix) from a detailed root analysis. With these expression data, we identified 689 and 1,481 local coexpression domains, respectively, consisting of two to four genes with a pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficient larger than 0.7. This number is approximately 1- to 5-fold higher than the numbers expected by chance. A small (5{\%}-10{\%}) yet significant fraction of genes in the Arabidopsis genome is therefore organized into local coexpression domains. These local coexpression domains were distributed over the genome. Genes in such local domains were for the major part not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). Neither tandemly duplicated genes nor shared promoter sequence nor gene distance explained the occurrence of coexpression of genes in such chromosomal domains. This indicates that other parameters in genes or gene positions are important to establish coexpression in local domains of Arabidopsis chromosomes.},

However, nucleosome mapping has been performed for only limited genomic regions in humans. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome.},

abstract = {We have come a long way since the first reports of the existence of aberrant DNA methylation in human cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is now firmly established as an important mechanism for gene inactivation. CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumor type. Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), p14(ARF)), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13), detoxification (GSTP1), etc em leader However, we still know little of the mechanisms of aberrant methylation and why certain genes are selected over others. Hypermethylation is not an isolated layer of epigenetic control, but is linked to the other pieces of the puzzle such as methyl-binding proteins, DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylase, but our understanding of the degree of specificity of these epigenetic layers in the silencing of specific tumor suppressor genes remains incomplete. The explosion of user-friendly technologies has given rise to a rapidly increasing list of hypermethylated genes. Careful functional and genetic studies are necessary to determine which hypermethylation events are truly relevant for human tumorigenesis. The development of CpG island hypermethylation profiles for every form of human tumors has yielded valuable pilot clinical data in monitoring and treating cancer patients based in our knowledge of DNA methylation. Basic and translational will both be needed in the near future to fully understand the mechanisms, roles and uses of CpG island hypermethylation in human cancer. The expectations are high.},

abstract = {Although most CpG islands are generally thought to remain unmethylated in all adult somatic tissues, recent genome-wide approaches have found that some CpG islands have distinct methylation patterns in various tissues, with most differences being seen between germ cells and somatic tissues. Few studies have addressed this among human somatic tissues and fewer still have studied the same sets of tissues from multiple individuals. In the current study, we used Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning to study tissue specific methylation patterns in a set of twelve human tissues collected from multiple individuals. We identified 34 differentially methylated CpG islands among these tissues, many of which showed consistent patterns in multiple individuals. Of particular interest were striking differences in CpG island methylation, not only among brain regions, but also between white and grey matter of the same region. These findings were confirmed for selected loci by quantitative bisulfite sequencing. Cluster analysis of the RLGS data indicated that several tissues clustered together, but the strongest clustering was in brain. Tissues from different brain regions clustered together, and, as a group, brain tissues were distinct from either mesoderm or endoderm derived tissues which demonstrated limited clustering. These data demonstrate consistent tissue specific methylation for certain CpG islands, with clear differences between white and grey matter of the brain. Furthermore, there was an overall pattern of tissue specifically methylated CpG islands that distinguished neural tissues from non-neural.},

abstract = {The p16INK4 gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently altered in lung cancers. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the p16INK4 gene seems to be the major mechanism through which p16INK4 become inactivated. Hypermethylation of the p16INK4 gene was reported to occur at an early stage in lung cancer. To determine whether the change in p16INK4 methylation status occurs at the late stage in the progression of primary lung cancers, we analyzed the primary and metastatic tumor tissues and normal lung samples from 29 cases of advanced lung cancer with distant metastasis. In each tissue sample, we analyzed the p16INK4 and p15INK4b genes for mutations and the methylation status of both genes using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism, direct sequencing, and methylation-specific PCR analysis. We also analyzed a subset of the samples for p16INK4 protein expression. Genetic mutations in the coding region of the p16INK4 and p15INK4b genes were not found in any of the examined specimens. The promoter region of the p16INK4 gene was hypermethylated in the tumor samples of the primary or metastatic site of 37.0{\%} (10 of 27) of the subjects. The promoter region of the p16INK4 gene was hypermethylated at both the primary and metastatic sites in two of the 10 cases and at only the metastatic site in 8 cases. By immunohistochemical analysis, we confirmed the presence of p16INK4 protein at the primary site of all cases in which the promoter region of the p16INK4 gene was hypermethylated at only the metastatic site. Interestingly, all 8 cases with a hypermethylated p16INK4 promoter region, at only the metastatic site, did not have p53 mutation. The results of this study indicate that tumor cells in which the p16INK4 gene has been inactivated by hypermethylation of the promoter region could have an advantage in progression and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancers, especially in the tumors with normal p53, and that the frequency of p16INK4 gene inactivation by hypermethylation could vary in clinical course.

abstract = {DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable interest in the last few years. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing, has been most extensively studied. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. New information concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to the discovery of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. The contribution of dietary folate and methylene terahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms to methylation patterns in normal and cancer tissues is under intense investigation. As methylation occurs early and can be detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Because DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like 5'-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating agents such as antisense DNA methyl transferase and small interference RNA are being developed, making the field of DNA methylation wider and more exciting.},

Data that violate these assumptions can often be brought in line with the assumptions by application of a transformation. Gene-expression microarray data have a complicated error structure, with a variance that changes with the mean in a non-linear fashion. Log transformations, which are often applied to microarray data, can inflate the variance of observations near background. RESULTS: We introduce a transformation that stabilizes the variance of microarray data across the full range of expression. Simulation studies also suggest that this transformation approximately symmetrizes microarray data.},

We have used a dual-labeling nearest neighbor technique and bisulphite genomic sequencing methods to investigate the nearest neighbors of 5-methylcytosine residues in mammalian DNA. We find that embryonic stem cells, but not somatic tissues, have significant cytosine-5 methylation at CpA and, to a lesser extent, at CpT. As the expression of the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3a correlates well with the presence of non-CpG methylation, we asked whether Dnmt3a might be responsible for this modification. Analysis of genomic methylation in transgenic Drosophila expressing Dnmt3a reveals that Dnmt3a is predominantly a CpG methylase but also is able to induce methylation at CpA and at CpT.},

abstract = {Methylation at position 5 of cytosine in DNA is an important event in epigenetic changes of cells, the methylation being linked to the control of gene functions. The DNA methylation can be analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing, and a large body of data have now been accumulated, based on which causation of diseases, for example cancer, and many other manifestations of cellular activities have been discussed intensively. This article gives an extensive account of the chemical aspects of bisulfite modification of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine in DNA. Various factors that affect the action of bisulfite are discussed, and a recent progress from our laboratory is explained. Conventional procedures for the bisulfite treatment consist incubation of single-stranded DNA with sodium bisulfite under acidic conditions. This treatment converts cytosine into uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains unchanged. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the bisulfite-treated DNA followed by sequencing can result in revealing the positions of 5-methylcytosine in the gene. We have discovered that the whole procedure can be significantly speeded up by the use of a highly concentrated bisulfite solution, 10 M ammonium bisulfite. Another recent finding is that urea, which has been often added to the reaction mixture with the purpose of facilitating the bisulfite-mediated deamination of cytosine in DNA, may not work as anticipated: we have observed that urea does not show such promoting actions in our treatments of DNA. A laboratory protocol for quantifying bisulfite, suitably simple for routine practice to ensure valid experiments, is described.},

A subset of colorectal tumors has an exceptionally high frequency of methylation of some CpG islands, leading to the suggestion of a distinct trait referred to as 'CpG island methylator phenotype', or 'CIMP'. However, the existence of CIMP has been challenged. To resolve this continuing controversy, we conducted a systematic, stepwise screen of 195 CpG island methylation markers using MethyLight technology, involving 295 primary human colorectal tumors and 16,785 separate quantitative analyses. We found that CIMP-positive (CIMP+) tumors convincingly represent a distinct subset, encompassing almost all cases of tumors with BRAF mutation (odds ratio = 203). Sporadic cases of mismatch repair deficiency occur almost exclusively as a consequence of CIMP-associated methylation of MLH1 . We propose a robust new marker panel to classify CIMP+ tumors.},

In colorectal cancer, a group of tumors is characterized by a hypermethylator phenotype termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which includes methylation of such genes as p16 and hMLH1. To study whether CIMP is present in gastric cancer, the methylation status of five newly cloned CpG islands was examined in 56 gastric cancers using bisulfite-PCR. Simultaneous methylation of three loci or more was observed in 23 (41{\%}) of 56 cancers, which suggests that these tumors have the hypermethylator phenotype CIMP. There was a significant concordance between CIMP and the methylation of known genes including p16, and hMLH1; methylation of p16 was detected in 16 (70{\%}) of 23 CIMP+ tumors, 1 (8{\%}) of 12 CIMP intermediate tumors, and 1 (5{\%}) of 21 CIMP- tumors (P{\textless}0.0001). Methylation of the hMLH1 gene was detected in three of five tumors that showed microsatellite instability, and all three of the cases were CIMP+. The CIMP phenotype is an early event in gastric cancer, being present in the normal tissue adjacent to cancer in 5 of 56 cases. These results suggest that CIMP may be one of the major pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis in gastric cancers.},

To understand global patterns of CpG island methylation in colorectal cancer, we have used a recently developed technique called methylated CpG island amplification to examine 30 newly cloned differentially methylated DNA sequences. Of these 30 clones, 19 (63{\%}) were progressively methylated in an age-dependent manner in normal colon, 7 (23{\%}) were methylated in a cancer-specific manner, and 4 (13{\%}) were methylated only in cell lines. Thus, a majority of CpG islands methylated in colon cancer are also methylated in a subset of normal colonic cells during the process of aging. In contrast, methylation of the cancer-specific clones was found exclusively in a subset of colorectal cancers, which appear to display a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP+ tumors also have a high incidence of p16 and THBS1 methylation, and they include the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability related to hMLH1 methylation. We thus define a pathway in colorectal cancer that appears to be responsible for the majority of sporadic tumors with mismatch repair deficiency.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that cancer represents an alteration in DNA, heritable by progeny cells, that leads to abnormally regulated expression of normal cellular genes; DNA alterations such as mutations, rearrangements and changes in methylation have been proposed to have such a role. Because of increasing evidence that DNA methylation is important in gene expression (for review see refs 7, 9-11), several investigators have studied DNA methylation in animal tumours, transformed cells and leukaemia cells in culture. The results of these studies have varied; depending on the techniques and systems used, an increase, decrease, or no change in the degree of methylation has been reported. To our knowledge, however, primary human tumour tissues have not been used in such studies. We have now examined DNA methylation in human cancer with three considerations in mind: (1) the methylation pattern of specific genes, rather than total levels of methylation, was determined; (2) human cancers and adjacent analogous normal tissues, unconditioned by culture media, were analysed; and (3) the cancers were taken from patients who had received neither radiation nor chemotherapy. In four of five patients studied, representing two histological types of cancer, substantial hypomethylation was found in genes of cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts. This hypomethylation was progressive in a metastasis from one of the patients.},

We have analyzed 375 genes and 58 pseudogenes from the human entries in the EMBL Database for the presence of CpG islands. All 240 islands identified are associated with genes, and almost all cover at least a part of one exon; i.e., they are useful landmarks in the genome for identifying genes. More than half of the genes analyzed were associated with islands. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40{\%} of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. In this latter group of genes, the position of the islands was not biased toward the 5' end of the transcription unit.},

abstract = {CpG islands are useful markers for genes in organisms containing 5-methylcytosine in their genomes. In addition, CpG islands located in the promoter regions of genes can play important roles in gene silencing during processes such as X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and silencing of intragenomic parasites. The generally accepted definition of what constitutes a CpG island was proposed in 1987 by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [Gardiner-Garden, M. {\&} Frommer, M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 261-282] as being a 200-bp stretch of DNA with a C+G content of 50{\%} and an observed CpG/expected CpG in excess of 0.6. Any definition of a CpG island is somewhat arbitrary, and this one, which was derived before the sequencing of mammalian genomes, will include many sequences that are not necessarily associated with controlling regions of genes but rather are associated with intragenomic parasites. We have therefore used the complete genomic sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 to examine the properties of CpG islands in different sequence classes by using a search algorithm that we have developed. Regions of DNA of greater than 500 bp with a G+C equal to or greater than 55{\%} and observed CpG/expected CpG of 0.65 were more likely to be associated with the 5' regions of genes and this definition excluded most Alu-repetitive elements. We also used genome sequences to show strong CpG suppression in the human genome and slight suppression in Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This finding is compatible with the recent detection of 5-methylcytosine in Drosophila, and might suggest that S. cerevisiae has, or once had, CpG methylation.},

@article{Gardiner-Garden1987,
abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G+C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5' and 3' CpG islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5' CpG islands extended through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the 3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes, composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG islands. G/C boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3' CpG islands, as well as in 5' CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5' CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested: that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the structural stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG islands associated with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for the maintenance of CpG islands as "methylation-free zones" in germline DNA.},

abstract = {DNA methylation represents a form of genome annotation that mediates gene repression by serving as a maintainable mark that can be used to reconstruct silent chromatin following each round of replication. During development, germline DNA methylation is erased in the blastocyst, and a bimodal pattern is established anew at the time of implantation when the entire genome gets methylated while CpG islands are protected. This brings about global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells of the body. Postimplantation development is characterized by stage- and tissue-specific changes in methylation that ultimately mold the epigenetic patterns that define each individual cell type. This is directed by sequence information in DNA and represents a secondary event that provides long-term expression stability. Abnormal methylation changes play a role in diseases, such as cancer or fragile X syndrome, and may also occur as a function of aging or as a result of environmental influences.},

Transposon promoters are inactive when methylated and, over time, C--{\textgreater}T transition mutations at methylated sites destroy many transposons. Apart from that subset of genes subject to X inactivation and genomic imprinting, no cellular gene in a non-expressing tissue has been proven to be methylated in a pattern that prevents transcription. It has become increasingly difficult to hold that reversible promoter methylation is commonly involved in developmental gene control; instead, suppression of parasitic sequence elements appears to be the primary function of cytosine methylation, with crucial secondary roles in allele-specific gene expression as seen in X inactivation and genomic imprinting.},

Here we describe the development of a calibrated biosensor that measures forces across specific proteins in cells with piconewton (pN) sensitivity, as demonstrated by single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy. The method is applied to vinculin, a protein that connects integrins to actin filaments and whose recruitment to focal adhesions (FAs) is force-dependent. We show that tension across vinculin in stable FAs is approximately 2.5 pN and that vinculin recruitment to FAs and force transmission across vinculin are regulated separately. Highest tension across vinculin is associated with adhesion assembly and enlargement. Conversely, vinculin is under low force in disassembling or sliding FAs at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, vinculin is required for stabilizing adhesions under force. Together, these data reveal that FA stabilization under force requires both vinculin recruitment and force transmission, and that, surprisingly, these processes can be controlled independently.},

However, these techniques have various limitations, and considerable effort is being devoted to specific labeling of proteins in vivo with small synthetic molecules capable of probing and modulating their function. These approaches are currently based on the noncovalent binding of a small molecule to a protein, the formation of stable complexes between biarsenical compounds and peptides containing cysteines, or the use of biotin acceptor domains. Here we describe a general method for the covalent labeling of fusion proteins in vivo that complements existing methods for noncovalent labeling of proteins and that may open up new ways of studying proteins in living cells.},

abstract = {The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue. In eukaryotes, the N-end rule pathway is a ubiquitin-dependent, proteasome-based system that targets and processively degrades proteins bearing certain N-terminal residues. Arg-DHFR, a modified dihydrofolate reductase bearing an N-terminal arginine (destabilizing residue in the N-end rule), is short lived in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract. It is shown here that methotrexate, which is a folic acid analog and high affinity ligand of DHFR, inhibits the degradation but not ubiquitination of Arg-DHFR by the N-end rule pathway. The degradation of other N-end rule substrates is not affected by methotrexate. We discuss implications of these results for the mechanism of proteasome-mediated protein degradation.},

We report a 1.5 A x-ray crystal structure of the first identified outer mitochondrial membrane Fe-S protein, mitoNEET. Two protomers intertwine to form a unique dimeric structure that constitutes a new fold to not only the approximately 650 reported Fe-S protein structures but also to all known proteins. We name this motif the NEET fold. The protomers form a two-domain structure: a beta-cap domain and a cluster-binding domain that coordinates two acid-labile 2Fe-2S clusters. Binding of pioglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, stabilizes the protein against 2Fe-2S cluster release. The biophysical properties of mitoNEET suggest that it may participate in a redox-sensitive signaling and/or in Fe-S cluster transfer.},

abstract = {The actin cross-linking protein alpha-actinin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the beta 1 subunit of integrin, suggesting that alpha-actinin may form a direct link between the actin cytoskeleton and the transmembrane fibronectin receptor. In this study, we have used short synthetic peptides to localize the binding site for alpha-actinin within the cytoplasmic domain of beta 1 integrin. Four 13-residue peptides were tested in both an affinity chromatographic assay and a solid-phase binding assay. The results indicated that two regions of sequence contribute to the binding of alpha-actinin: one near where the beta 1 cytoplasmic tail emerges from the membrane and a second segment located near the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. This binding pattern was investigated in more detail using an adaptation of the mimotope assay, in which each of the 32 overlapping sequential decapeptide segments from the beta 1 cytoplasmic domain was assembled on the head of a different plastic pin. The peptide-pin constructs were used to detect the binding of 125I-alpha-actinin. As predicted from our initial results, alpha-actinin was found to bind to two distinct clusters of peptide segments. This represents a novel use of the mimotope pin assay to map interactive sites on structural proteins.},

abstract = {The cytoplasmic domains (tails) of heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors mediate integrins' biological functions by binding to cytoplasmic proteins. Most integrin beta tails contain one or two NPXYF motifs that can form beta turns. These motifs are part of a canonical recognition sequence for phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, protein modules that are present in a wide variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. Indeed, talin and ICAP1-alpha bind to integrin beta tails by means of a PTB domain-NPXY ligand interaction. To assess the generality of this interaction we examined the binding of a series of recombinant PTB domains to a panel of short integrin beta tails. In addition to the known integrin-binding proteins, we found that Numb (a negative regulator of Notch signaling) and Dok-1 (a signaling adaptor involved in cell migration) and their isolated PTB domain bound to integrin tails. Furthermore, Dok-1 physically associated with integrin alpha IIb beta 3. Mutations of the integrin beta tails confirmed that these interactions are canonical PTB domain-ligand interactions. First, the interactions were blocked by mutation of an NPXY motif in the integrin tail. Second, integrin class-specific interactions were observed with the PTB domains of Dab, EPS8, and tensin. We used this specificity, and a molecular model of an integrin beta tail-PTB domain interaction to predict critical interacting residues. The importance of these residues was confirmed by generation of gain- and loss-of-function mutations in beta 7 and beta 3 tails. These data establish that short integrin beta tails interact with a large number of PTB domain-containing proteins through a structurally conserved mechanism.},

Our results are in agreement with the concept of a "balloon on a string" for the molecular shape of native vinculin. The existence of dimer and oligomer structures in low ionic strength buffer can be excluded. The calculated dimensions of the head fragment were estimated to r = 3.3 nm for a spherical particle, but the diffusion coefficient suggests a slightly anisotropic shape. In solution, the rod-like tail exhibits some flexibility, which is probably located in the "neck region" of the protein, considering the known sequence data.},

(ii) The targeting fragment had two short regions of homology with the endogenous Hprt gene: one, 132 base pairs long and the other, 1.2 kilobase pairs long. Targeted cells in which the designed homologous recombination event occurred were isolated either by selection with G418 followed by 6-thioguanine or by selection with 6-thioguanine alone. Even though less than 2 kilobases of homology existed between the exogenous and target DNAs, an average of 2.6 embryonic stem cells were successfully targeted for every 10(5) colonies surviving electroporation. Six of the Hprt- cell lines showed homologous recombination. These six lines were further analyzed by nucleotide sequencing a fragment that spans one crossover point after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Four lines had the expected sequence, whereas two lines had small deletions abutting the 132-base-pair region of homology.},

abstract = {The Cre protein encoded by the coliphage P1 is a 38-kDa protein that efficiently promotes both intra- and intermolecular synapsis and recombination of DNA both in Escherichia coli and in vitro. Recombination occurs at a specific site, called lox, and does not require any other protein factors. The Cre protein is shown here also to be able to cause synapsis of DNA and site-specific recombination in a mammalian cell line. A stable mouse cell line was established that expresses the Cre protein under the control of the Cd2+-inducible metallothionein I gene promoter. DNA recombination was monitored with DNA substrates containing two directly repeated lox sites. One such substrate is a circular plasmid with two directly repeated lox sites (lox2) flanking a marker gene and was introduced into cells by Ca3(PO4)2 transformation. As a second substrate we used a pseudorabies virus (a herpesvirus) containing a lox2 insertion designed to provide a sensitive detection system for recombination. In both cases, site-specific recombination in vivo is dependent on the presence of the Cre protein and occurs specifically at the 34-base-pair lox sites. These results demonstrate the controlled site-specific synapsis of DNA and recombination by a prokaryotic protein in mammalian cells and suggest that Cre-mediated site-specific recombination may be a useful tool for understanding and modulating genome rearrangements in eukaryotes.},

This neck region links the vinculin head, probably consisting of the biochemically defined 90-kDa N-terminal fragment, to the rod-like tail. The hinge allows for sharp kinks in the molecule, so that head and tail structures can contact each other. By electron spectroscopic imaging, we were able to reveal substructural components in both head and tail regions. The head resembles a cloverleaf-like structure, consisting of three globular centers of mass, surrounding a protein-deficient center in a planar arrangement and of a short, stem-like fragment. The tail contains four spherical protein masses arranged like pearls on a string. Our data reveal a substructural organization of vinculin which is consistent with its presumed function as a structural component of microfilament attachment sites and support the concept of cryptic ligand-binding domains, previously based on biochemical evidence.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences. Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence space (oligo "clouds"). We show here that P-clouds predicts {\textgreater}840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome, thus suggesting that 66{\%}-69{\%} of the human genome is repetitive or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp). Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation that reflects this fact. We further developed "element-specific" P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive sequence than previously believed.},

abstract = {A human homologue (hDREF/KIAA0785) of Drosophila DREF, a transcriptional regulatory factor required for expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell proliferation, was identified by BLAST search. Amino acid sequences corresponding to three regions highly conserved between two Drosophila species also proved to be very similar in the hDREF/KIAA0785 polypeptide. A consensus binding sequence (5'-TGTCG(C/T)GA(C/T)A) for hDREF/KIAA0785, determined by the CASTing method, overlapped with that for the Drosophila DREF (5'-TGTCGATA). We found hDREF/KIAA0785 binding sequences in the promoter regions of human genes related to cell proliferation. Analyses using a specific antibody revealed that an hDREF/KIAA0785 binds to the promoter region of the histone H1 gene. Co-transfection experiments with an hDREF/KIAA0785-expressing plasmid and a histone H1 promoter-directed luciferase reporter plasmid in HeLa cells revealed possible activation of the histone H1 promoter. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that hDREF/KIAA0785 is localized in the nuclei. Although the expression level of the factor was found to be low in serum-deprived human normal fibroblasts, the amount was increased by adding serum to cultures and reached a maximum during S phase. RNA interference experiments targeting hDREF/KIAA0785 resulted in inhibition of S phase entry and reduction of histone H1 mRNA in HeLa cells. These results suggest that expression of hDREF/KIAA0785 may have a role in regulation of human genes related to cell proliferation.},

abstract = {We previously demonstrated that hDREF, a human homologue of Drosophila DNA replication-related element binding factor (dDREF), is a DNA-binding protein predominantly distributed with granular structures in the nucleus. Here, glutathione S-transferase pulldown and chemical cross-linking assays showed that the carboxyl-terminal hATC domain of hDREF, highly conserved among hAT transposase family members, possesses self-association activity. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that hDREF self-associates in vivo, dependent on hATC domain. Moreover, analyses using a series of hDREF mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the hATC domain revealed that conserved hydrophobic amino acids are essential for self-association. Immunofluorescence studies further showed that all hDREF mutants lacking self-association activity failed to accumulate in the nucleus. Self-association-defective hDREF mutants also lost association with endogenous importin beta1. Moreover, electrophoretic gel-mobility shift assays revealed that the mutations completely abolished the DNA binding activity of hDREF. These results suggest that self-association of hDREF via the hATC domain is necessary for its nuclear accumulation and DNA binding. We also found that ZBED4/KIAA0637, another member of the human hAT family, also self-associates, again dependent on the hATC domain, with deletion resulting in loss of efficient nuclear accumulation. Thus, hATC domains of human hAT family members appear to have conserved functions in self-association that are required for nuclear accumulation.},

abstract = {Enhancer function underlies regulatory processes by which cells establish patterns of gene expression. Recent results suggest that many enhancers are specified by particular chromatin marks in pluripotent cells, which may be modified later in development to alter patterns of gene expression and cell differentiation choices. These marks may contribute to the repertoire of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for cellular memory and determine the timing of transcription factor accessibility to the enhancer. Mechanistically, cohesin and non-coding RNAs are emerging as crucial players responsible for facilitating enhancer-promoter interactions at some genes. Surprisingly, these interactions may be required not only to facilitate initiation of transcription but also to activate the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal pausing.},

To gain insight into how these DNA elements are conserved and spread through the genome, we defined the full spectrum of CTCF-binding sites, including a 33/34-mer motif, and identified over five thousand highly conserved, robust, and tissue-independent CTCF-binding locations by comparing ChIP-seq data from six mammals. Our data indicate that activation of retroelements has produced species-specific expansions of CTCF binding in rodents, dogs, and opossum, which often functionally serve as chromatin and transcriptional insulators. We discovered fossilized repeat elements flanking deeply conserved CTCF-binding regions, indicating that similar retrotransposon expansions occurred hundreds of millions of years ago. Repeat-driven dispersal of CTCF binding is a fundamental, ancient, and still highly active mechanism of genome evolution in mammalian lineages.},

abstract = {The role of central tolerance induction has recently been revised after the discovery of promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens in the thymus. The extent of tissue representation afforded by this mechanism and its cellular and molecular regulation are barely defined. Here we show that medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are specialized to express a highly diverse set of genes representing essentially all tissues of the body. Most, but not all, of these genes are induced in functionally mature CD80(hi) mTECs. Although the autoimmune regulator (Aire) is responsible for inducing a large portion of this gene pool, numerous tissue-restricted genes are also up-regulated in mature mTECs in the absence of Aire. Promiscuously expressed genes tend to colocalize in clusters in the genome. Analysis of a particular gene locus revealed expression of clustered genes to be contiguous within such a cluster and to encompass both Aire-dependent and -independent genes. A role for epigenetic regulation is furthermore implied by the selective loss of imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene in mTECs. Our data document a remarkable cellular and molecular specialization of the thymic stroma in order to mimic the transcriptome of multiple peripheral tissues and, thus, maximize the scope of central self-tolerance.},

In vertebrates, insulator's function requires association with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a protein that recognizes long and diverse nucleotide sequences. While insulators are critical in gene regulation, only a few have been reported. Here, we describe 13,804 CTCF-binding sites in potential insulators of the human genome, discovered experimentally in primary human fibroblasts. Most of these sequences are located far from the transcriptional start sites, with their distribution strongly correlated with genes. The majority of them fit to a consensus motif highly conserved and suitable for predicting possible insulators driven by CTCF in other vertebrate genomes. In addition, CTCF localization is largely invariant across different cell types. Our results provide a resource for investigating insulator function and possible other general and evolutionarily conserved activities of CTCF sites.},

abstract = {Insulators are DNA elements that prevent inappropriate interactions between the neighboring regions of the genome. They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

abstract = {Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.  Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.  Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

abstract = {The multifunctional zinc-finger protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a very strong candidate for the role of coordinating the expression level of coding sequences with their three-dimensional position in the nucleus, apparently responding to a "code" in the DNA itself. Dynamic interactions between chromatin fibers in the context of nuclear architecture have been implicated in various aspects of genome functions. However, the molecular basis of these interactions still remains elusive and is a subject of intense debate. Here we discuss the nature of CTCF-DNA interactions, the CTCF-binding specificity to its binding sites and the relationship between CTCF and chromatin, and we examine data linking CTCF with gene regulation in the three-dimensional nuclear space. We discuss why these features render CTCF a very strong candidate for the role and propose a unifying model, the "CTCF code," explaining the mechanistic basis of how the information encrypted in DNA may be interpreted by CTCF into diverse nuclear functions.},

abstract = {The CTCF transcription factor is an 11 zinc fingers multifunctional protein that uses different zinc finger combinations to recognize and bind different sites within DNA. CTCF is thought to participate in various gene regulatory networks including transcription activation and repression, formation of independently functioning chromatin domains and regulation of imprinting. Sequencing of human and other genomes opened up a possibility to ascertain the genomic distribution of CTCF binding sites and to identify CTCF-dependent cis-regulatory elements, including insulators. In the review, we summarized recent data on genomic distribution of CTCF binding sites in the human and other genomes within a framework of the loop domain hypothesis of large-scale regulation of the genome activity. We also tried to formulate possible lines of studies on a variety of CTCF functions which probably depend on its ability to specifically bind DNA, interact with other proteins and form di- and multimers. These three fundamental properties allow CTCF to serve as a transcription factor, an insulator and a constitutive dispersed genome-wide demarcation tool able to recruit various factors that emerge in response to diverse external and internal signals, and thus to exert its signal-specific function(s).},

It is now well established that inter- and intra-connections occur between chromosomes and play a major role in gene regulations. These interconnections are mainly orchestrated by the CTCF protein, which is also known as the "master weaver" of the genome. Recent advances in sequencing and genome-wide studies revealed that CTCF binds to DNA at thousands of sites within the human genome, providing the possibility to form thousands of genomic connection hubs. Strikingly, two histone variants, namely H2A.Z and H3.3, strongly co-localize at CTCF binding sites. In this article, we will review the recent advances in CTCF biology and discuss the role of histone variants H2A.Z and H3.3 at CTCF binding sites.},

Here we present a high-throughput 3C approach, 3C-Carbon Copy (5C), that employs microarrays or quantitative DNA sequencing using 454-technology as detection methods. We applied 5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human beta-globin locus and a 100-kb conserved gene desert region. We validated 5C by detection of several previously identified looping interactions in the beta-globin locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the beta-globin Locus Control Region and the gamma-beta-globin intergenic region. Interestingly, this region has been implicated in the control of developmental globin gene switching. 5C should be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis- and trans- interaction networks of genomic elements and for the study of higher-order chromosome structure.},

Initial events involve receptor homo- or heterodimerization and subsequent recruitment of cytosolic signaling proteins to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Intermediate events involve the translocation of proteins into the nucleus. Late events involve the recruitment of transcriptional activators to the vicinity of specific genes in the nucleus, resulting in increased gene transcription. The ability to induce signals at each of these three phases of signaling pathways is illustrated by the use of a heterodimeric chemical inducer of dimerization that causes a proximal relationship between two different target proteins.},

abstract = {We have developed a general method of making conditional alleles that allows the rapid and reversible regulation of specific proteins. A mouse line was produced in which proteins encoded by the endogenous glycogen synthase kinase-3 $\beta$ (GSK-3$\beta$) gene are fused to an 89 amino acid tag, FRB*. FRB* causes the destabilization of GSK-3$\beta$, producing a severe loss-of-function allele. In the presence of C20-MaRap, a highly specific, nontoxic, cell-permeable small molecule, GSK-3$\beta$FRB* binds to the ubiquitously expressed FKBP12 protein. This interaction stabilizes GSK-3$\beta$FRB* and restores both protein levels and activity. C20-MaRap-mediated stabilization is rapidly reversed by the addition of an FKBP12 binding competitor molecule. This technology may be applied to a wide range of FRB*-tagged mouse genes while retaining their native transcriptional control. Inducible stabilization could be valuable for many developmental and physiological studies and for drug target validation.},

abstract = {Focal adhesions (FAs) regulate cell migration. Vinculin, with its many potential binding partners, can interconnect signals in FAs. Despite the well-characterized structure of vinculin, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action have remained unclear. Here, using vinculin mutants, we separate the vinculin head and tail regions into distinct functional domains. We show that the vinculin head regulates integrin dynamics and clustering and the tail regulates the link to the mechanotransduction force machinery. The expression of vinculin constructs with unmasked binding sites in the head and tail regions induces dramatic FA growth, which is mediated by their direct interaction with talin. This interaction leads to clustering of activated integrin and an increase in integrin residency time in FAs. Surprisingly, paxillin recruitment, induced by active vinculin constructs, occurs independently of its potential binding site in the vinculin tail. The vinculin tail, however, is responsible for the functional link of FAs to the actin cytoskeleton. We propose a new model that explains how vinculin orchestrates FAs.},

MHC class I and class II molecules possess highly similar structural features used to load peptides. Specifically, both contain peptide-binding grooves formed by two $\alpha$-helices and eight $\beta$-strands. In the peptide-binding groove, specific amino acids compose pockets that accommodate the corresponding side chains of the anchor residues of the presented peptides. Peptide-binding preferences exist among different alleles of both of MHC I and MHC II molecules, which are mainly dependent on amino acid polymorphisms in the peptide-binding grooves of MHC chains. Aside from the common binding of peptides to MHC molecules, the currently determined structures of post-translationally modified peptides to MHC molecules demonstrate that the modified groups have important roles in the peptide–MHC interaction. The illumination of the binding features of peptides to MHC molecules has aided our understanding of T-cell-specific immunity and the development of T-cell epitope-related vaccines.},

abstract = {Vinculin is a conserved component and an essential regulator of both cell-cell (cadherin-mediated) and cell-matrix (integrin-talin-mediated focal adhesions) junctions, and it anchors these adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton by binding to talin in integrin complexes or to alpha-actinin in cadherin junctions. In its resting state, vinculin is held in a closed conformation through interactions between its head (Vh) and tail (Vt) domains. The binding of vinculin to focal adhesions requires its association with talin. Here we report the crystal structures of human vinculin in its inactive and talin-activated states. Talin binding induces marked conformational changes in Vh, creating a novel helical bundle structure, and this alteration actively displaces Vt from Vh. These results, as well as the ability of alpha-actinin to also bind to Vh and displace Vt from pre-existing Vh-Vt complexes, support a model whereby Vh functions as a domain that undergoes marked structural changes that allow vinculin to direct cytoskeletal assembly in focal adhesions and adherens junctions. Notably, talin's effects on Vh structure establish helical bundle conversion as a signalling mechanism by which proteins direct cellular responses.},

abstract = {Although vinculin is present at all sites of F-actin attachment to plasma membranes and is required for linkage of myofibrils to sarcolemma, it is unclear how it promotes attachment of actin to membranes. Because biochemical evidence for a direct interaction of vinculin with F-actin is controversial, current models of actin-membrane linkages depict only an indirect role for vinculin, as a tether for alpha-actinin. We demonstrate here that an intramolecular association between the 95K head and 30K tail domains of vinculin masks an F-actin binding site present in the carboxy-terminal tail domain. Cosedimentation and crosslinking assays, and direct visualization by transmission electron microscopy, reveal an interaction between F-actin and a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing amino acids 811-1066 of vinculin, and between F-actin and a proteolytic fragment of vinculin containing amino acids 858-1066. Vinculin itself neither cosediments with nor crosslinks F-actin. The amino-terminal 95K head fragment of vinculin, but not intact vinculin, inhibits both cosedimentation and crosslinking. We propose that assembly of vinculin into an adherens junction involves disruption of the head-tail interaction, revealing a site that mediates microfilament attachment.},

abstract = {Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein involved in actin-membrane attachment at sites of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein occurs during integrin-mediated cell adhesion, embryonic development, fibroblast transformation and following stimulation of cells by mitogens that operate through the family of seven membrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors. Paxillin binds in vitro to the focal adhesion protein vinculin as well as to the SH3 domain of c-src and, when tyrosine phosphorylated, to the SH2 domain of v-crk. Here, we report the complementary DNA, and derived amino acid sequence, that codes for approximately 90{\%} of the paxillin protein. We have identified a region in the amino-terminal half of the protein that supports the binding of both vinculin and the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, pp125Fak. Although there is no significant overall homology with other identified proteins, the carboxyl third of paxillin contains one LIM domain and three LIM-like sequences. The LIM motif is common to a number of transcription factors and to two other focal adhesion proteins, zyxin and cysteine-rich protein. In addition to several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites there are five tyrosine-containing sequences that conform to SH2-binding motifs. The protein also contains a short proline-rich region indicative of a SH3-binding domain. Taken together, these data suggest that paxillin is a unique cytoskeletal protein capable of interaction with a variety of intracellular signalling, and structural, molecules important in growth control and the regulation of cytoskeletal organization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Studies were carried out using vinculin-deficient F9 embryonic carcinoma (gamma229) cells to analyze the relationship between structure and function within the focal adhesion protein vinculin, in the context of control of cell shape, cell mechanics, and movement. Atomic force microscopy studies revealed that transfection of the head (aa 1-821) or tail (aa 811-1066) domain of vinculin, alone or together, was unable to fully reverse the decrease in cell stiffness, spreading, and lamellipodia formation caused by vinculin deficiency. In contrast, replacement with intact vinculin completely restored normal cell mechanics and spreading regardless of whether its tyrosine phosphorylation site was deleted. Constitutively active rac also only induced extension of lamellipodia when microinjected into cells that expressed intact vinculin protein. These data indicate that vinculin's ability to physically couple integrins to the cytoskeleton, to mechanically stabilize cell shape, and to support rac-dependent lamellipodia formation all appear to depend on its intact three-dimensional structure.},

abstract = {T-cell-specific immunity functions in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent manner. MHC molecules present antigenic peptides on the surface of cells to be recognised by specific T-cells. MHC class I and class II molecules possess highly similar structural features used to load peptides. Specifically, both contain peptide-binding grooves formed by two $\alpha$-helices and eight $\beta$-strands. In the peptide-binding groove, specific amino acids compose pockets that accommodate the corresponding side chains of the anchor residues of the presented peptides. Peptide-binding preferences exist among different alleles of both of MHC I and MHC II molecules, which are mainly dependent on amino acid polymorphisms in the peptide-binding grooves of MHC chains. Aside from the common binding of peptides to MHC molecules, the currently determined structures of post-translationally modified peptides to MHC molecules demonstrate that the modified groups have important roles in the peptide–MHC interaction. The illumination of the binding features of peptides to MHC molecules has aided our understanding of T-cell-specific immunity and the development of T-cell epitope-related vaccines.},

abstract = {Recombination contributes to the generation of genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) but can only occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of HIV infection. Here we describe examples of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple HIV strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

abstract = {In the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, molecular evolutionary studies of primate lentiviruses provide the most definitive information about the origins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2. Related lentiviruses have been found infecting numerous species of primates in sub-Saharan Africa. The only species naturally infected with viruses closely related to HIV-2 is the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) from western Africa, the region where HIV-2 is known to be endemic. Similarly, the only viruses very closely related to HIV-1 have been isolated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and in particular those from western equatorial Africa, again coinciding with the region that appears to be the hearth of the HIV-1 pandemic. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have each arisen several times: in the case of HIV-1, the three groups (M, N and O) are the result of independent cross-species transmission events. Consistent with the phylogenetic position of a 'fossil' virus from 1959, molecular clock analyses using realistic models of HIV-1 sequence evolution place the last common ancestor of the M group prior to 1940, and several lines of evidence indicate that the jump from chimpanzees to humans occurred before then. Both the inferred geographical origin of HIV-1 and the timing of the cross-species transmission are inconsistent with the suggestion that oral polio vaccines, putatively contaminated with viruses from chimpanzees in eastern equatorial Africa in the late 1950s, could be responsible for the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.},

To test the hypothesis that such isolates might represent only a subset of a larger, genetically more diverse group of viruses, we used nested polymerase chain reactions to characterize HIV-2 sequences in uncultured mononuclear blood cells of two healthy Liberian agricultural workers, from whom virus isolation was repeatedly unsuccessful, and from a culture-positive symptomatic urban dweller. Analysis of pol, env and long terminal repeat regions revealed the presence of three highly divergent HIV-2 strains, one of which (from one of the healthy subjects) was significantly more closely related to simian immunodeficiency viruses infecting sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques (SIVSM/SIVMAC) than to any virus of human derivation. This subject also harboured multiply defective viral genotypes that resulted from hypermutation of G to A bases. Our results indicate that HIV-2, SIVSM and SIVMAC comprise a single, highly diverse group of lentiviruses which cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages according to species of origin.},

abstract = {The human AIDS viruses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) represent cross-species (zoonotic) infections. Although the primate reservoir of HIV-2 has been clearly identified as the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), the origin of HIV-1 remains uncertain. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been isolated from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), but only three such SIVcpz infections have been documented, one of which involved a virus so divergent that it might represent a different primate lentiviral lineage. In a search for the HIV-1 reservoir, we have now sequenced the genome of a new SIVcpzstrain (SIVcpzUS) and have determined, by mitochondrial DNA analysis, the subspecies identity of all known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. We find that two chimpanzee subspecies in Africa, the central P. t. troglodytes and the eastern P. t. schweinfurthii, harbour SIVcpz and that their respective viruses form two highly divergent (but subspecies-specific) phylogenetic lineages. All HIV-1 strains known to infect man, including HIV-1 groups M, N and O, are closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages, that found in P. t. troglodytes. Moreover, we find that HIV-1 group N is a mosaic of SIVcpzUS- and HIV-1-related sequences, indicating an ancestral recombination event in a chimpanzee host. These results, together with the observation that the natural range of P. t. troglodytes coincides uniquely with areas of HIV-1 group M, N and O endemicity, indicate that P. t. troglodytes is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 and has been the source of at least three independent introductions of SIVcpz into the human population.},

This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS.},

The T-cell tropism of HTLV and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as AIDS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor (TCGF) an shown to express HTLV antigens. Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to HTLV subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not HTLV-I or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others.

abstract = {Within 1 year of the initial report in 1981 of a deadly new disease that occurred predominantly in previously healthy persons and was manifested by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, the disease had a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Within 2 years, the causative agent had been identified: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). On the 30th anniversary of the epidemic, to characterize trends in HIV infection and AIDS in the United States during 1981-2008, CDC analyzed data from the National HIV Surveillance System. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in the first 14 years, sharp increases were reported in the number of new AIDS diagnoses and deaths among persons aged≥13 years, reaching highs of 75,457 in 1992 and 50,628 in 1995, respectively. With introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, AIDS diagnoses and deaths declined substantially from 1995 to 1998 and remained stable from 1999 to 2008 at an average of 38,279 AIDS diagnoses and 17,489 deaths per year, respectively. Despite the decline in AIDS cases and deaths, at the end of 2008 an estimated 1,178,350 persons were living with HIV, including 236,400 (20.1{\%}) whose infection was undiagnosed. These findings underscore the importance of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy focus on reducing HIV risk behaviors, increasing opportunities for routine testing, and enhancing use of care (1).},

abstract = {Four previously healthy homosexual men contracted Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, extensive mucosal candidiasis, and multiple viral infections. In three of the patients these infections followed prolonged fevers of unknown origin. In all four cytomegalovirus was recovered from secretions. Kaposi's sarcoma developed in one patient eight months after he presented with esophageal candidiasis. All patients were anergic and lymphopenic; they had no lymphocyte proliferative responses to soluble antigens, and their responses to phytohemagglutinin were markedly reduced. Monoclonal-antibody analysis of peripheral-blood T-cell subpopulations revealed virtual elimination of the Leu-3 / helper/inducer subset, an increased percentage of the Leu-2 + suppressor/cytoxic subset, and an increased percentage of cells bearing the thymocyte-associated antigen T10. The inversion of the T/ helper to suppressor/cytotoxic ratio suggested that cytomegalovirus infection was an important factor in the pathogenesis of the immunodeficient state. A high level of exposure of male homosexuals to cytomegalovirus-infected secretions may account for the occurrence of this immune deficiency.},

In this review, we provide a brief history of HIV/AIDS, followed by analysis of one therapeutic target of HIV-1: its reverse transcriptase (RT). We discuss the biochemical characterization of RT in order to place emphasis on possible avenues of inhibition, which now includes both nucleoside and non-nucleoside modalities. Therapies against RT remain a cornerstone of anti-HIV treatment, but the virus eventually resists inhibition through the selection of drug-resistant RT mutations. Current inhibitors and associated resistance are discussed, with the hopes that new therapeutics can be developed against RT.},

But the primary interest, both with respect to structure as well as function, has concentrated on HLA-A and -B molecules because of their high sequence polymorphism and their dominating presence at the cell surface. In contrast, HLA-C molecules seemed to be of only minor importance in the cascade of immune reactions owing to their more limited polymorphism and reduced levels of surface expression. The inability to define a number of antigen specificities had the result that HLA-C molecules were often neglected in studies of immune response, transplantation, and disease association. More recently a new function has been identified for HLA class I molecules where they act as inhibitors of the lytic capacity of natural killer (NK) cells and non-MHC-restricted T-cells. Moreover, the understanding of this novel mode of negative regulation of cytotoxicity was remarkably influenced by HLA-C since these were the first HLA class I molecules found to have such inhibitory potential. With this new inhibitory function serving as an essential component of the immune system, HLA-C molecules can no longer be neglected.},

abstract = {The genomic region encompassing the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) contains polymorphic frozen blocks which have developed by local imperfect sequential duplication associated with insertion and deletion (indels). In the alpha block surrounding HLA-A, there are ten duplication units or beads on the 62.1 ancestral haplotype. Each bead contains or contained sequences representing Class I, PERB11 (MHC Class I chain related (MIC) and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) 16. Here we consider explanations for co-occurrence of genomic polymorphism, duplication and HERVs and we ask how these features encode susceptibility to numerous and very diverse diseases. Ancestral haplotypes differ in their copy number and indels in addition to their coding regions. Disease susceptibility could be a function of all of these differences. We propose a model of the evolution of the human MHC. Population-specific integration of retroviral sequences could explain rapid diversification through duplication and differential disease susceptibility. If HERV sequences can be protective, there are exciting prospects for manipulation. In the meanwhile, it will be necessary to understand the function of MHC genes such as PERB11 (MIC) and many others discovered by genomic sequencing.},

HLA class I molecules present pathogen-derived peptides on the surface of infected cells for recognition by CD8+ T cells. However, the relative contributions of HLA-A and -B alleles have not been evaluated. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the class I restricted CD8+ T-cell responses against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), immune control of which is dependent upon virus-specific CD8+ T-cell activity. In 375 HIV-1-infected study subjects from southern Africa, a significantly greater number of CD8+ T-cell responses are HLA-B-restricted, compared to HLA-A (2.5-fold; P = 0.0033). Here we show that variation in viral set-point, in absolute CD4 count and, by inference, in rate of disease progression in the cohort, is strongly associated with particular HLA-B but not HLA-A allele expression (P {\textless} 0.0001 and P = 0.91, respectively). Moreover, substantially greater selection pressure is imposed on HIV-1 by HLA-B alleles than by HLA-A (4.4-fold, P = 0.0003). These data indicate that the principal focus of HIV-specific activity is at the HLA-B locus. Furthermore, HLA-B gene frequencies in the population are those likely to be most influenced by HIV disease, consistent with the observation that B alleles evolve more rapidly than A alleles. The dominant involvement of HLA-B in influencing HIV disease outcome is of specific relevance to the direction of HIV research and to vaccine design.},

abstract = {A key role in cell-mediated immunity is dedicated to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that bind peptides for presentation on the cell surface. Several in silico methods capable of predicting peptide binding to MHC class I have been developed. The accuracy of these methods depends on the data available characterizing the binding specificity of the MHC molecules. It has, moreover, been demonstrated that consensus methods defined as combinations of two or more different methods led to improved prediction accuracy. This plethora of methods makes it very difficult for the non-expert user to choose the most suitable method for predicting binding to a given MHC molecule. In this study, we have therefore made an in-depth analysis of combinations of three state-of-the-art MHC-peptide binding prediction methods (NetMHC, NetMHCpan and PickPocket). We demonstrate that a simple combination of NetMHC and NetMHCpan gives the highest performance when the allele in question is included in the training and is characterized by at least 50 data points with at least ten binders. Otherwise, NetMHCpan is the best predictor. When an allele has not been characterized, the performance depends on the distance to the training data. NetMHCpan has the highest performance when close neighbours are present in the training set, while the combination of NetMHCpan and PickPocket outperforms either of the two methods for alleles with more remote neighbours. The final method, NetMHCcons, is publicly available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCcons , and allows the user in an automatic manner to obtain the most accurate predictions for any given MHC molecule.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Receptor-ligand interactions play an important role in controlling many biological systems. One prominent example is the binding of peptides to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules controlling the onset of cellular immune responses. Thousands of MHC allelic versions exist, making determination of the binding specificity for each variant experimentally infeasible. Here, we present a method that can extrapolate from variants with known binding specificity to those where no experimental data are available. RESULTS: For each position in the peptide ligand, we extracted the polymorphic pocket residues in MHC molecules that are in close proximity to the peptide residue. For MHC molecules with known specificities, we established a library of pocket-residues and corresponding binding specificities. The binding specificity for a novel MHC molecule is calculated as the average of the specificities of MHC molecules in this library weighted by the similarity of their pocket-residues to the query. This PickPocket method is demonstrated to accurately predict MHC-peptide binding for a broad range of MHC alleles, including human and non-human species. In contrast to neural network-based pan-specific methods, PickPocket was shown to be robust both when data is scarce and when the similarity to MHC molecules with characterized binding specificity is low. A consensus method combining the PickPocket and NetMHCpan methods was shown to achieve superior predictive performance. This study demonstrates how integration of diverse algorithmic approaches can lead to improved prediction. The method may also be used for making ligand-binding predictions for other types of receptors where many variants exist.},

abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are encoded by extremely polymorphic genes and play a crucial role in immunity. However, not all genetically different MHC molecules are functionally different. Sette and Sidney (1999) have defined nine HLA class I supertypes and showed that with only nine main functional binding specificities it is possible to cover the binding properties of almost all known HLA class I molecules. Here we present a comprehensive study of the functional relationship between all HLA molecules with known specificities in a uniform and automated way. We have developed a novel method for clustering sequence motifs. We construct hidden Markov models for HLA class I molecules using a Gibbs sampling procedure and use the similarities among these to define clusters of specificities. These clusters are extensions of the previously suggested ones. We suggest splitting some of the alleles in the A1 supertype into a new A26 supertype, and some of the alleles in the B27 supertype into a new B39 supertype. Furthermore the B8 alleles may define their own supertype. We also use the published specificities for a number of HLA-DR types to define clusters with similar specificities. We report that the previously observed specificities of these class II molecules can be clustered into nine classes, which only partly correspond to the serological classification. We show that classification of HLA molecules may be done in a uniform and automated way. The definition of clusters allows for selection of representative HLA molecules that can cover the HLA specificity space better. This makes it possible to target most of the known HLA alleles with known specificities using only a few peptides, and may be used in construction of vaccines.

abstract = {In this paper we describe an improved neural network method to predict T-cell class I epitopes. A novel input representation has been developed consisting of a combination of sparse encoding, Blosum encoding, and input derived from hidden Markov models. We demonstrate that the combination of several neural networks derived using different sequence-encoding schemes has a performance superior to neural networks derived using a single sequence-encoding scheme. The new method is shown to have a performance that is substantially higher than that of other methods. By use of mutual information calculations we show that peptides that bind to the HLA A*0204 complex display signal of higher order sequence correlations. Neural networks are ideally suited to integrate such higher order correlations when predicting the binding affinity. It is this feature combined with the use of several neural networks derived from different and novel sequence-encoding schemes and the ability of the neural network to be trained on data consisting of continuous binding affinities that gives the new method an improved performance. The difference in predictive performance between the neural network methods and that of the matrix-driven methods is found to be most significant for peptides that bind strongly to the HLA molecule, confirming that the signal of higher order sequence correlation is most strongly present in high-binding peptides. Finally, we use the method to predict T-cell epitopes for the genome of hepatitis C virus and discuss possible applications of the prediction method to guide the process of rational vaccine design.},

abstract = {In order to quantify each specific HLA-A or -B antigen on platelets, a monoclonal antibody against HLA heavy chains was developed and designated as 2F2 monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody reacted on Western blot with platelet HLA from each of 10 individuals with different HLA phenotypes and precipitated all 35S-methionine-labeled HLA-A and -B antigens from three different Epstein-Barr Virus--transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. The results indicate that the 2F2 monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope shared by different HLA-A and -B antigens. The quantitative variation of specific HLA antigens on platelets was then studied in nine different donors by isoelectric-focusing gel electrophoresis and immunoblot using the 2F2 monoclonal antibody. The results of our studies showed that the shared HLA antigens such as A2, B35, and B62, varied three- to fivefold among different individuals and individual HLA-A or -B antigen was not equally expressed on a person's platelets. The relative quantities of specific HLA-A and -B antigens on lymphocytes were also noted to be the same as those on platelets. The finding suggests that differential expression of HLA specificities may not be restricted to platelets but is a more general phenomenon including other nucleated cells.},

Precise quantitation of HLA antigens was achieved by means of an enzyme-linked immunoassay using the W6/32 monoclonal antibody and purified HLA molecules. The mean plasma and platelet HLA concentrations were 2.04 +/- 1.67 micrograms/ml (+/- SD, n = 215) and 11.28 +/- 4.65 fg/cell (+/- SD, n = 213), respectively. Statistical analysis of associations between HLA phenotypes and plasma HLA revealed that the mean plasma HLA concentration of individuals with HLA-A23 or HLA-A24 was 1.4 (p less than 0.002) or 1.9 (p less than 0.001) times higher than those without these two HLA antigens. Furthermore, the mean plasma HLA concentration of individuals who have HLA-A26 was 25{\%} less than those without HLA-A26 (p less than 0.05). In contrast, the only association between HLA phenotypes and HLA concentrations of platelets was observed in HLA-B7-positive individuals. The mean platelet HLA concentration of HLA-B7 individuals was 27{\%} higher than those without HLA-B7 (p less than 0.005). This finding is in accordance with previous observations made on red blood cells. The results indicate that the HLA concentrations in plasma are regulated, at least in part, by genetic factors that are different from those regulating platelet HLA.},

An mAb that reacts with a well-defined monomorphic epitope in the alpha 3 domain of the heavy chains of HLA molecules was developed and used to quantify each HLA-A or -B antigen on western blots of IEF gels. The results of these studies demonstrated that the relative quantities of HLA-A and -B antigens in platelets and MNLs of an individual did not change over time. Further studies showed that the relative quantities of HLA-A and -B antigens for haplotypes shared among first-degree relatives were always the same and followed Mendelian inheritance. In contrast, the relative quantities of HLA-A and -B antigens for a haplotype shared by unrelated individuals varied significantly. All these findings support the hypothesis that the quantitative expression of HLA antigens is genetically predetermined and may play important roles in determining disease susceptibility and severity.},

abstract = {Previous studies showed that different HLA-A and -B antigens are differentially expressed in cells. Their relative quantities are genetically predetermined and inherited according to Mendelian laws. To investigate mechanisms responsible for this differential expression, a correlation study between the relative quantities of different HLA-A and -B proteins and their mRNA levels in eight different HLA-phenotyped lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were performed. The results show proportional correlation in all the studied cell lines except those that are positive for HLA-A24. Study of the turnover of HLA antigens reveals that different HLA-A and -B antigens are proportionally degraded. Measurement of the relative quantities of HLA-A and -B mRNAs in six LCLs before and after treatment with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, demonstrates that HLA-A and -B mRNAs are proportionally degraded except slight differences in two LCLs. Measurement of the relative quantities of different HLA-A and -B pre-mRNAs in nuclei shows that they are not proportional to the relative quantities of their respective mature mRNAs in cytoplasm in four of six LCLs. These results indicate that combinations of different regulatory steps which include gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA degradation are involved in the genetically predetermined quantitative differential expression of HLA-A and -B antigens. Transcription of HLA genes and splicing of HLA pre-mRNAs appear to be the dominant regulatory steps.},

abstract = {The regulation by IFN of the expression of HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 class I molecules was studied in Jurkat human T lymphoma cells, HHK EBV-transformed human B lymphocytes, and murine HLA-B7 HLA-A3 co-transfected L fibroblasts. Jurkat cells express constitutively low level of HLA class I molecules and treatment with human IFN resulted in preferential increase of the expression of HLA-B7 molecules, the expression of the HLA-A3 molecules being relatively unchanged. Similar treatment of HHK cells, which express constitutively large amount of HLA class I molecules, resulted in a marginal increase of the expression of both HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 molecules. HLA-B7 HLA-A3 co-transfected L cells express relatively low level of HLA class I molecules, expression of both however was significantly increased after treatment with murine INF-alpha, the augmentation being more accentuated for HLA-B7 molecules. In all cases, variations of cell surface expression were related to parallel modifications of the level of HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 RNA transcripts. Important nucleotide differences exist between the IFN consensus sequences associated with the HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 class I genes. Using oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences two patterns of retarded bands were observed by the gel mobility shift assay, suggesting that the IFN-mediated differential regulation of the expression of the HLA-B7 and HLA-A3 genes could be due to different nuclear regulatory factors.},

It is shown in MOLT-4, and in its derived line YHHH, that HLA-B mRNA levels are undetectable before treatment but respond to IFN-alpha and -gamma more markedly than those of HLA-A. This differential induction is best shown with YHHH, which is hypersensitive to IFN-alpha, where the HLA-B mRNA levels increase to a level threefold those of HLA-A. Other thymocyte lines tested also showed preferential induction by IFN-alpha of HLA-B, although the basal levels of HLA-A and -B tended to be similar.

After several cycles of selection, mutant clones with low (greater than 10{\%} of wild-type) and high (three times better) response were obtained. A similar protocol was employed to derive high responder mutants with the monoclonal antibody YT76, which recognises a subset of HLA strongly induced by IFN-alpha. Stable clones were derived for which YT-HLA induction was 7-fold that of Molt 4 cells and for which HLA induction occurred at 100-fold lower concentrations of IFN-alpha. The high response phenotype of the mutants was not accompanied by a significant increase in the constitutive level of expression of HLA-A,B,C (in the absence of IFN). The increase in the level of HLA-A,B,C expression after IFN-alpha treatment is mostly accounted for by the increase in the expression of a subset of HLA molecules, detected by the monoclonal antibody YT76 including HLA-B molecules.},

We have therefore determined the effects of IFN treatment, EBV transformation, and influenza virus infection on the quantitative expression of total HLA antigens and the relative quantities of different specific HLA-A and -B antigens in human fibroblast cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. In contrast to earlier studies using the transfected HLA genes, our results show that different individual HLA-A and -B antigens are proportionally and not differentially amplified during upregulated expression of total class I HLA molecules.

abstract = {Efficient immune responses against pathogens are frequently characterized by the simultaneous targeting of multiple epitopes. However, it remains unclear how the targeting of multiple epitopes is maintained in the face of competition for antigenic stimulation. Here, we investigate this question by using mathematical models of the population dynamics of a viral pathogen, antigen presentation sites and T-cells. We first show that direct competition for access to antigen presenting sites and indirect competition through killing of the pathogen select for dominance of the T-cell response with the highest affinity for its epitope. We then incorporate in our model that epitopes can become down-modulated following interaction with epitope specific T-cells. We demonstrate that epitope down-modulation leads to differentiation of epitope presentation on antigen presenting sites. This differentiation promotes the coexistence of multiple epitope specific responses. Hence, we propose that the functional relevance of epitope down-modulation may be to enable the persistence of a broad immune response despite competition for antigenic stimulation.},

abstract = {Both theoretical predictions and experimental findings suggest that T cell populations can compete with each other. There is some debate on whether T cells compete for aspecific stimuli, such as access to the surface on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or for specific stimuli, such as their cognate epitope ligand. We have developed an individual-based computer simulation model to study T cell competition. Our model shows that the expression level of foreign epitopes per APC determines whether T cell competition is mainly for specific or aspecific stimuli. Under low epitope expression, competition is mainly for the specific epitope stimuli, and, hence, different epitope-specific T cell populations coexist readily. However, if epitope expression levels are high, aspecific competition becomes more important. Such between-specificity competition can lead to competitive exclusion between different epitope-specific T cell populations. Our model allows us to delineate the circumstances that facilitate coexistence of T cells of different epitope specificity. Understanding mechanisms of T cell coexistence has important practical implications for immune therapies that require a broad immune response.},

abstract = {CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection are characterized by the emergence of dominant and subdominant CTL populations. The immunodominance hierarchies of these populations are highly reproducible for any given spectrum of virus-induced peptide-MHCI complexes and are likely determined by multiple factors. Recent studies demonstrate a direct correlation between naive epitope-specific CD8+ T cell precursor (CTLp) frequency and the magnitude of the response after antigen challenge. Thus, the number of available precursors in the naive pool has emerged as a key predictor of immunodominance. In contrast to this, we report here no consistent relationship between CTLp frequency and the subsequent magnitude of the immune response for 4 influenza virus-derived epitopes following intranasal infection of mice with influenza A virus. Rather, the characteristic, antigen-driven T cell immunodominance hierarchy was determined by the extent of recruitment from the available pool of epitope-specific precursors and the duration of their continued expansion over the course of the infection. These findings suggest possibilities for enhancing protective immune memory by maximizing both the size and diversity of typically subdominant T cell responses through rational vaccine design.},

abstract = {We have investigated mechanisms involved in immunodominance of the CTL response of C57BL/6 (B6) mice against cells of BALB.B origin. This transplantation barrier consists of at least 40 minor histocompatibility (H) Ags. Insufficient presentation of nondominant epitopes in the presence of dominant epitopes was investigated as a possible mechanism for immunodominance. Ag presentation was assessed by recognition of dendritic cells of BALB.B origin, MLC restimulatory capacity, and quantification of cell surface presentation by peptide elution from intact cells. Cells from BALB.B mice, which fail to elicit CTL against nondominant epitopes, presented nondominant epitopes to a similar extent as cells from minor H congenic mice; the latter do elicit CTL against nondominant minor H Ags. Nevertheless, presentation of nondominant and dominant epitopes by the same APC appeared to be an important factor for immunodominance to occur, since simultaneous immunization with the epitopes on separate cells elicited CTL against both types of epitopes. This suggested that immunodominance is determined in the interaction between different responding T cells and the APC. Support for this was obtained in an in vitro model in which the CTL response against a nondominant epitope was inhibited by the concomitant response against a dominant epitope. This study suggests that immunodominance in the CTL response against certain minor H Ags results from interference between T cell responses and not from insufficient presentation of peptide epitopes. The study also provides an in vitro model for further investigations of the immunodominance phenomenon.},

abstract = {The HLA-related, polymorphic MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) gene encodes a 383-amino acid polypeptide, with three extracellular domains (alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3), a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. We have previously shown that freshly isolated endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes and monocytes express MICA, while peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ or CD19+ lymphocytes do not. This polymorphic MICA molecule is a target for specific alloantibodies in sera from kidney, heart and lung transplant recipients, although its possible role during graft rejection remains to be demonstrated. In this study we investigated whether there is codominance in the expression of MICA. We isolated RNA from a heterozygous cell line (HCT116), previously shown by sequencing-based typing to be MICA*001/MICA*00902, as well as 12 clones derived from it. Thereafter, we retrotranscribed the RNA into cDNA, and performed a molecular typing using MICA-sequence specific oligonucleotides (SSOP). Using this approach, we detected the RNA encoding MICA*001 and MICA*00902 in all the clones and in the parental cell line, indicating that MICA is codominantly expressed. This codominant expression was further confirmed by cloning and sequencing plasmids encoding these two alleles produced from the same HCT116 RNA preparation. We also produced the two recombinant MICA proteins (MICA*001 and MICA*00902). They reacted with rabbit anti-MICA polyclonal antibodies by ELISA and Western blot, indicating that the plasmids carrying the cDNA inserts probably encode functional MICA proteins. This strongly suggests that, like the HLA class I and class II proteins, MICA is codominantly expressed. The codominant expression of the polymorphic, HLA-like MICA alloantigens may have implications for the immune response elicited by the allograft in organ transplantation.},

At present, the system contains data from 1133 populations in 608,813 individuals on the frequency of genes from different polymorphic regions such as human leukocyte antigens, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, major histocompatibility complex Class I chain-related genes and a number of cytokine gene polymorphisms. The project was designed to create a central source for the storage of frequency data and provide individuals with a set of bioinformatics tools to analyze the occurrence of these variants in worldwide populations. The resource has been used in a wide variety of contexts, including clinical applications (histocompatibility, immunology, epidemiology and pharmacogenetics) and population genetics. Demographic information, frequency data and searching tools can be freely accessed through the website.},

abstract = {The HLA system is the most polymorphic of all human genetic systems. The frequency of HLA class I alleles and their linkage disequilibrium patterns differ significantly among human populations as shown in studies using serologic methods. Many DNA-defined alleles with identical serotypes may have variable frequencies in different populations. We typed HLA-A, B, and C loci at the allele level by PCR-based methods in 1,296 unrelated subjects from five major outbred groups living in the U.S.A (African, AFAM; Caucasians, CAU; Asian, ORI; Hispanic, HIS, and North American Natives, NAI). We detected 46, 100 and 32 HLA-A, B, and C alleles, respectively. ORI and HIS presented more alleles at each of these loci. There was lack of correlation between the levels of heterozygosity and the number of alleles detected in each population. In AFAM, heterozygosity ({\textgreater}90{\%}) is maximized at all class I loci. HLA-A had the lowest heterozygosity in all populations but CAU. Tight LD was observed between HLA-B and C alleles. AFAM had weaker or nonexistent associations between alleles of HLA-A and B than other populations. Analysis of the genetic distances between these and other populations showed a close relationship between specific US populations and a population from their original continents. ORI exhibited the largest genetic distance with all the other U.S. groups and were closer to NAI. Evidence of admixture with CAU was observed for AFAM and HIS. HIS also had significant frequencies of AFAM and Mexican Indian alleles. Differences in both LD and heterozygosity levels suggest distinct evolutionary histories of the HLA loci in the geographical regions from where the U.S. populations originated.},

abstract = {To investigate the diversity of the T cell repertoire involved in human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infections, peripheral blood T cell subsets were analyzed by using a PCR-based assay that permits determination of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length variation in TCR Vbeta transcripts. In two of four asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers and in four of five patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), mono- or oligoclonal expansions were detected in the CD4+ T cell subset. In one patient with adult T cell leukemia, a specific clone bearing Vbeta7 was detected in the CD4+ T cell subset. In contrast, clonal expansion was not observed in the CD4 T cell subsets of three individuals with asymptomatic HTLV-II infection or in our previous studies of a large number of uninfected individuals. Oligoclonal expansions in the CD8+ T cell subset were detected in all subjects, including the patient with adult T cell leukemia. No differences in the number of expanded clones were noted between asymptomatic carriers and in patients with HAM/TSP and there was no obvious restriction in the TCR V region usage. Direct sequencing revealed no significant bias in the CDR3 motifs utilized by the predominant clones. This report is the first direct demonstration of clonal expansions within fractionated T cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) in HTLV-I infections and suggests that 1) clonal expansion of CD4+ T lymphocytes likely occurs as a direct result of infection and 2) polyclonal CD8+ T cell expansion occurs frequently and independently of disease association.},

abstract = {During LCMV infection, CD8+ T cells expand greatly. Bystander activation has been thought to play a role because few cells score as LCMV specific in limiting dilution analysis. In contrast, we find that at least a quarter of the CD8+ cells secrete IFNgamma specifically in response to LCMV peptides at the peak of the response. Moreover, by analyzing the expansion of adoptively transferred LCMV-specific, TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells in congenic hosts, we have determined that most of the CD8+ cell expansion is virus specific. Analysis of the effect of the monospecific TCR-transgenic T cells on the host response to three LCMV epitopes suggests that CTL precursors compete for sites on the APC in an epitope-specific fashion and that this competition determines the specificity of the response.},

abstract = {Based on T cell subset depletion studies and the analysis of gene knockout mice, it is evident that CD8(+) T cells contribute to resistance against intracellular infections with certain viral, protozoan, and bacterial pathogens. Although they are known primarily for their capacity to kill infected cells, CD8(+) T cells elaborate a variety of effector mechanisms with the potential to defend against infection. Microbes use multiple strategies to cause infection, and the nature of the pathogenhost interaction may determine which CD8(+) T cell effector mechanisms are required for immunity. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the effector functions used by CD8(+) T cells in resistance to pathogens. Analyses of mice deficient in perforin and/or Fas demonstrate that cytolysis is critical for immunity against some, but not all, infections and also reveal the contribution of cytolysis to the pathogenesis of disease. The role of CD8(+) T cell-derived cytokines in resistance to infection has been analyzed by systemic treatment with neutralizing antibodies and cytokine gene knockout mice. These studies are complicated by the fact that few, if any, cytokines are uniquely produced by CD8(+) T cells. Thus, the requirement for CD8(+) T cell- derived cytokines in resistance against most pathogens remains to be defined. Finally, recent studies of human CD8(+) T cells reveal the potential for novel effector mechanisms in resistance to infection.},

abstract = {CD4(+) T cells are activated upon recognition of peptide antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules, expressed by specialized APC. In this study, we show that CD4(+) T cells cross-compete for antigenic complexes on the surface of APC, inhibiting activation of other potentially reactive T cells of the same and differing specificities. T cells with either a higher affinity receptor for antigen or which have undergone prior activation compete more efficiently than low affinity or resting T cells. This implies that T-cell avidity for the APC is primarily responsible for the competitive advantage. We also provide evidence that the mechanism for competition is steric hindrance of the surface of the APC, rather than T-cell-mediated sequestration or internalization of antigenic complexes. This is because removal of competing T cells restores the antigenic potential of the APC, and APC fixation does not abrogate competition. Demonstration that competition for access to APC can also occur in vivo suggests that this process may represent a physiologically important mechanism for influencing the quality and quantity of CD4(+) T-cell responses.},

We report here that culture of the murine lymphoma mutant cell line RMA-S at reduced temperature (19-33 degrees C) promotes assembly, and results in a high level of cell surface expression of H-2/beta 2-microglobulin complexes that do not present endogenous antigens, and are labile at 37 degrees C. They can be stabilized at 37 degrees C by exposure to specific peptides known to interact with H-2Kb or Db. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of peptides, class I molecules can assemble but are unstable at body temperature. The induction of such molecules at reduced temperature opens new ways to analyse the nature of MHC class I peptide interactions at the cell surface.},

abstract = {Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules interact with self and foreign peptides of diverse amino acid sequences yet exhibit distinct allele-specific selectivity for peptide binding. The structures of the peptide-binding specificity pockets (subsites) in the groove of murine H-2Kb as well as human histocompatibility antigen class I molecules have been analyzed. Deep but highly conserved pockets at each end of the groove bind the amino and carboxyl termini of peptide through extensive hydrogen bonding and, hence, dictate the orientation of peptide binding. A deep polymorphic pocket in the middle of the groove provides the chemical and structural complementarity for one of the peptide's anchor residues, thereby playing a major role in allele-specific peptide binding. Although one or two shallow pockets in the groove may also interact with specific peptide side chains, their role in the selection of peptide is minor. Thus, usage of a limited number of both deep and shallow pockets in multiple combinations appears to allow the binding of a broad range of peptides. This binding occurs with high affinity, primarily because of extensive interactions with the peptide backbone and the conserved hydrogen bonding network at both termini of the peptide. Interactions between the anchor residue (or residues) and the corresponding allele-specific pocket provide sufficient extra binding affinity not only to enhance specificity but also to endure the presentation of the peptide at the cell surface for recognition by T cells.},

abstract = {To study the structure of a homogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule containing a single bound peptide, a complex of recombinant mouse H-2Kb, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m), and a fragment of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nuclear capsid protein, VSV-(N52-59) octapeptide (Arg-Gly-Tyr-Val-Tyr-Gln-Gly-Leu), was prepared by exploiting a high-yield bacterial expression system and in vitro cocomplex formation. The structure of mouse H-2Kb revealed its similarity to three human class I HLA molecules, consistent with the high primary sequence homology and common function of these peptide-presenting molecules. Electron density was located in the peptide-binding groove, to which a single peptide in a unique conformation was unambiguously fit. The peptide extends the length of the groove, parallel to the alpha-helices, and assumes an extended, mostly beta-strand conformation. The peptide is constrained within the groove by hydrogen bonding of its main-chain atoms and by contacts of its side chains with the H-2Kb molecule. The amino-terminal nitrogen atom of the peptide forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171 of H-2Kb at one end of the groove, while the carboxyl-terminal oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-84 at the other end. Since the amino acids at both ends are conserved among human and mouse MHC molecules, this anchoring of each end of the peptide appears to be a general feature of peptide-MHC class I molecule binding and imposes restrictions on its length. The side chains of residues Tyr-3, Tyr-5, and Leu-8 of the VSV octapeptide fit into the interior of the H-2Kb molecule with no appreciable surface exposure, a finding in support of previous biological studies that showed the importance of these residues for binding. Thus, the basis for binding of specific peptide sequences to the MHC class I molecule is the steric restriction imposed on the peptide side chains by the architecture of the floor and sides of the groove. The side chains of Arg-1, Val-4, and Gln-6 and the main-chain of Gly-7 of the octapeptide are exposed on the surface of the complex, thus confirming their availability for T-cell receptor contact, as previously demonstrated by T-cell recognition experiments.},

abstract = {The x-ray structures of a murine MHC class I molecule (H-2Kb) were determined in complex with two different viral peptides, derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein (52-59), VSV-8, and the Sendai virus nucleoprotein (324-332), SEV-9. The H-2Kb complexes were refined at 2.3 A for VSV-8 and 2.5 A for SEV-9. The structure of H-2Kb exhibits a high degree of similarity with human HLA class I, although the individual domains can have slightly altered dispositions. Both peptides bind in extended conformations with most of their surfaces buried in the H-2Kb binding groove. The nonamer peptide maintains the same amino- and carboxyl-terminal interactions as the octamer primarily by the insertion of a bulge in the center of an otherwise beta conformation. Most of the specific interactions are between side-chain atoms of H-2Kb and main-chain atoms of peptide. This binding scheme accounts in large part for the enormous diversity of peptide sequences that bind with high affinity to class I molecules. Small but significant conformational changes in H-2Kb are associated with peptide binding, and these synergistic movements may be an integral part of the T cell receptor recognition process.},

abstract = {MHC class I molecules are peptide receptors of stringent specificity which however still allow millions of different ligands. This is achieved by the following specificity characteristics summarized as allele specific peptide motifs: Peptides are of defined length, depending on the class I allele (either 8 or 9 residues; exceptions have been observed). Typically, 2 of the 8 or 9 positions are anchors that can only be occupied by a single amino acid residue, or by residues with closely related side chains. Location and characteristics of anchors vary with class I alleles. The C terminus of the peptide ligands is frequently an aliphatic or charged residue. Such allele-specific class I peptide ligand motifs, known so far for H-2Kd, Kb, Kk, Kkm1, Db, HLA-A*0201, A*0205, and B*2705, are useful to predict natural T cell epitopes. The latter can be determined by extraction from cells recognized by the T cell of interest. It is not known how the class I ligands are produced in the cell, although speculative models exist. The peptide specificity of class I molecules and experimental evidence indicate that T cells are tolerant to only a small fraction of the expressed genomic sequences and are not tolerant to the remainder. The function of class I molecules is to present a collection of self-peptide samples at the cell surface for surveillance by T cells.},

These peptides are presented by the products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC class I products present peptides derived by proteolysis of cytosolic proteins by the multicatalytic protease, the proteasome. These peptides are translocated from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by a dedicated peptide transporter, the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). TAP consists of two subunits, and translocates peptides that are approximately 8-12 residues in length. The COOH terminal residue of the peptide is a major determinant in the specificity of translocation. Following translocation, peptides bind to MHC class I molecules, which depend on the peptide ligand as well as on interactions with chaperonins for proper folding. These complexes then egress from the ER and are transported to their final destination, the cell surface.},

Before, peptide binding could only be reliably modelled for a few major human or mouse histocompatibility molecules; now, high-accuracy predictions are available for any human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -A or -B molecule with known protein sequence. Furthermore, peptide binding to MHC molecules from several non-human primates, mouse strains and other mammals can now be predicted. In this review, a number of different prediction methods are briefly explained, highlighting the most useful and historically important. Selected case stories, where these 'reverse immunology' systems have been used in actual epitope discovery, are briefly reviewed. We conclude that this new generation of epitope discovery systems has become a highly efficient tool for epitope discovery, and recommend that the less accurate prediction systems of the past be abandoned, as these are obsolete.},

abstract = {The ability of MHC molecules to present a broad spectrum of peptide antigens for T cell recognition requires a compromise between high affinity and broad specificity. Three-dimensional atomic structures of several class I and class II MHC molecules reveal a unique structural solution to this problem: Tight binding to the peptide main chain is supplemented by more or less restrictive interactions with peptide side chains. In spite of these contacts, peptide side-chain and conformational variability ensures that the resulting peptide-MHC complex presents an antigenically unique surface to T cell receptors. Extension of this understanding to other peptide-MHC complexes, including agonist/antagonist peptides and the identification of antigenic peptides within protein sequences, however, requires a detailed analysis of the interactions that determine both peptide-MHC binding affinity and the conformations of bound peptides. While many of these interactions can be modeled by homology with known structures, their specificity can depend sensitively on subtle and long-range structural effects. Structurally and immunologically important distinctions are also found between the class I and class II peptide-binding strategies. Taken together, these interactions ultimately determine the ability of an individual to respond successfully to immune challenges.},

abstract = {The H-2 complex of mice plays a major part in transplantation immunity. Genetical studies by Snell and his colleagues have revealed nine different combinations. Serological investigations have demonstrated five basic antigens, C, D, E, F and K. The distribution so far as it is known is given in the table. We postulate two alleles of E, and at least three of D. No allele of K has been definitely established as yet. The extreme polymorphism of the system is largely contributed by D and possibly by K as well. Difficulty in demonstrating allelomorphs may be attributable to the following factors: (1) technical difficulties in the demonstration of some partial antibodies in mice, (2) low concentration of certain antigens on the erythrocytes, (3) the small population so far studied serologically. Mutations have been shown to arise not infrequently in some strains studied in America and involve the simultaneous transformations of three antigens, we have found that two of the antigens known to have been involved are separable by crossing-over.},

abstract = {Of the many thousands of peptides encoded by a complex foreign antigen that can potentially be presented to CD8+ T cells (TCD8+), only a small fraction induce measurable responses in association with any given major histocompatibility complex class I allele. To design vaccines that elicit optimal TCD8+ responses, a thorough understanding of this phenomenon, known as immunodominance, is imperative. Here we review recent progress in unraveling the molecular and cellular basis for immunodominance. Of foremost importance is peptide binding to class I molecules; only approximately 1/200 of potential determinants bind at greater than the threshold affinity (Kd {\textgreater} 500 nM) associated with immunogenicity. Limitations in the TCD8+ repertoire render approximately half of these peptides nonimmunogenic, and inefficient antigen processing further thins the ranks by approximately four fifths. As a result, only approximately 1/2000 of the peptides in a foreign antigen expressed by an appropriate antigen presenting cell achieve immunodominant status with a given class I allele. A roughly equal fraction of peptides have subdominant status, i.e. they induce weak-to-nondetectable primary TCD8+ responses in the context of their natural antigen. Subdominant determinants may be expressed at or above levels of immunodominant determinants, at least on antigen presenting cells in vitro. The immunogenicity of subdominant determinants is often limited by immunodomination: suppression mediated by TCD8+ specific for immunodominant determinants. Immunodomination is a central feature of TCD8+ responses, as it even occurs among clones responding to the same immunodominant determinant. Little is known about how immunodominant and subdominant determinants are distinguished by the TCD8+ repertoire, or how (and why) immunodomination occurs, but new tools are available to address these questions.},

The potential contribution of the proteasome to the effect of flanking sequences on the presentation of an antigenic epitope presented by the major histocompatibility complex class I allele Ld was studied. Peptides generated in cells from minigenes coding for peptides of 17- and 19-amino acid length were compared with the in vitro 20S proteasome degradation products of the respective synthetic peptides. The quality of generated peptides was independent of ubiquitination. In vivo and in vitro processing products were indistinguishable with respect to peptide size and abundance. Altering the neighboring sequence substantially improved the yield of the final antigenic nonapeptide by 20S proteasome cleavage. These results suggest that, in addition to the presence of major histocompatibility complex class I allelic motifs, the cleavage preference of the proteasome can define the antigenic potential of a protein.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) perceive the world through small peptides that are eight to ten amino acids long. These peptides (epitopes) are initially generated by the proteasome, a multi-subunit protease that is responsible for the majority of intra-cellular protein degradation. The proteasome generates the exact C-terminal of CTL epitopes, and the N-terminal with a possible extension. CTL responses may diminish if the epitopes are destroyed by the proteasomes. Therefore, the prediction of the proteasome cleavage sites is important to identify potential immunogenic regions in the proteomes of pathogenic microorganisms (or humans). We have recently shown that NetChop, a neural network-based prediction method, is the best method available at the moment to do such predictions; however, its performance is still lower than desired. Here, we use novel sequence encoding methods and show that the new version of NetChop predicts approximately 10{\%} more of the cleavage sites correctly while lowering the number of false positives with close to 15{\%}. With this more reliable prediction tool, we study two important questions concerning the function of the proteasome. First, we estimate the N-terminal extension of epitopes after proteasomal cleavage and find that the average extension is relatively short. However, more than 30{\%} of the peptides have N-terminal extensions of three amino acids or more, and thus, N-terminal trimming might play an important role in the presentation of a substantial fraction of the epitopes. Second, we show that good TAP ligands have an increased chance of being cleaved by the proteasome, i.e., the specificity of TAP has evolved to fit the specificity of the proteasome. This evolutionary relationship allows for a more efficient antigen presentation.},

It is becoming clear that many of the latter encode proteins that are likely to be involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. The MHC is known to contribute to a large number of immune-related disorders including insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency and there is growing evidence that genes within the class III region are important in determining susceptibility to many of these complex conditions. Genes in the class III region have also been implicated in a number of non-immune-related diseases such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and sialidosis. Now that the full gene content of the class III region is known the stage is set for the identification and characterisation of candidate disease genes, which will allow greater understanding of the causes of many MHC-linked diseases and thus aid the development of improved treatments.},

Recently we reported that RAGE-HMGB1 critically regulates autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vivo and in vitro in response to chemotherapy. RAGE inhibits apoptosis ("programmed cell death") by a p53 transcription-independent pathway during the response to chemotherapeutic agents. RAGE sustains autophagy ("programmed cell survival") associated with decreased phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increased Beclin 1-Vps34 interaction. These findings provide insight into how autophagy- and apoptosis-crossregulatory molecules interact in response to cellular stress including tumor therapy.},

Although many of the 224 identified gene loci (128 predicted to be expressed) are still of unknown function, we estimate that about 40{\%} of the expressed genes have immune system function. Over 50{\%} of the MHC has been sequenced twice, in different haplotypes, giving insight into the extraordinary polymorphism and evolution of this region. Several genes, particularly of the MHC class II and III regions, can be traced by sequence similarity and synteny to over 700 million years ago, clearly predating the emergence of the adaptive immune system some 400 million years ago. The sequence is expected to be invaluable for the identification of many common disease loci. In the past, the search for these loci has been hampered by the complexity of high gene density and linkage disequilibrium.},

Each antigen comprised a glycosylated polypeptide of 43 000 molecular weight that is noncovalently associated with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m). Some small differences in molecular parameters were, however, revealed. Thus, the deoxycholate-solubilized HLA-CW2 antigen sedimented at the same rate as the HLA-A antigens but at a slightly faster rate than the HLA-B antigens. This variation is apparently is apparently due to different amounts of bound deoxycholate. Also, whereas essentially all of the HLA-A and B antigens and about half of the HLA-CW2 antigen were adsorbed strongly by Lens culinaris lectin-Sepharose, the remaining HLA-CW2 antigen was bound much more weakly and did not require sugar for elution. This difference reflects some structural heterogeneity in the carbohydrate moiety of the HLA-CW2 antigen. The results of various studies suggest that the HLA-CW2 antigen is expressed to a lower extent than the HLA-A or B antigens and that essentially all of the beta2m of the BRI 8 plasma membrane is associated with the HLA-A, B and C alloantigenic polypeptides.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The major histocompatibility complex class I protein HLA-C plays a crucial role as a molecule capable of sending inhibitory signals to both natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) via binding to killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR). Recently HLA-C has been recognized as a key molecule in the immune control of HIV-1. Expression of HLA-C is modulated by a microRNA binding site. HLA-C alleles that bear substitutions in the microRNA binding site are more expressed at the cell surface and associated with the control of HIV-1 viral load, suggesting a role of HLA-C in the presentation of antigenic peptides to CTLs. This review highlights the role of HLA-C in association with HIV-1 viral load, but also addresses the contradiction of the association between high cell surface expression of an inhibitory molecule and strong cell-mediated immunity. To explore additional mechanisms of control of HIV-1 replication by HLA-C, we address specific features of the molecule, like its tendency to be expressed as open conformer upon cell activation, which endows it with a unique capacity to associate with other cell surface molecules as well as with HIV-1 proteins.},

Herein, we briefly review the functions of IFN-gamma, the cells that produce it, the cell extrinsic signals that induce its production and influence the differentiation of na{\"{i}}ve T cells into IFN-gamma-producing effector T cells, and the signaling pathways and transcription factors that facilitate, induce, or repress production of this cytokine. We then review and discuss recent insights regarding the molecular regulation of IFN-gamma, focusing on work that has led to the identification and characterization of distal regulatory elements and epigenetic modifications with the IFN-gamma locus (Ifng) that govern its expression. The epigenetic modifications and three-dimensional structure of the Ifng locus in naive CD4 T cells, and the modifications they undergo as these cells differentiate into effector T cells, suggest a model whereby the chromatin architecture of Ifng is poised to facilitate either rapid opening or silencing during Th1 or Th2 differentiation, respectively.},

We therefore screened peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 57 individuals at different stages of HIV-1 infection for virus-specific T-cell responses using a matrix of 504 overlapping peptides spanning all expressed HIV-1 proteins in a gamma interferon-enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) assay. HIV-1-specific T-cell responses were detectable in all study subjects, with a median of 14 individual epitopic regions targeted per person (range, 2 to 42), and all 14 HIV-1 protein subunits were recognized. HIV-1 p24-Gag and Nef contained the highest epitope density and were also the most frequently recognized HIV-1 proteins. The total magnitude of the HIV-1-specific response ranged from 280 to 25,860 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMC (median, 4,245) among all study participants. However, the number of epitopic regions targeted, the protein subunits recognized, and the total magnitude of HIV-1-specific responses varied significantly among the tested individuals, with the strongest and broadest responses detectable in individuals with untreated chronic HIV-1 infection. Neither the breadth nor the magnitude of the total HIV-1-specific CD8+-T-cell responses correlated with plasma viral load. We conclude that a peptide matrix-based Elispot assay allows for rapid, sensitive, specific, and efficient assessment of cellular immune responses directed against the entire expressed HIV-1 genome. These data also suggest that the impact of T-cell responses on control of viral replication cannot be explained by the mere quantification of the magnitude and breadth of the CD8+-T-cell response, even if a comprehensive pan-genome screening approach is applied.},

abstract = {Selection of T-cell vaccine antigens for chronic persistent viral infections has been largely empirical. To define the relationship, at the population level, between the specificity of the cellular immune response and viral control for a relevant human pathogen, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the 160 dominant CD8(+) T-cell responses in 578 untreated HIV-infected individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Of the HIV proteins targeted, only Gag-specific responses were associated with lowering viremia. Env-specific and Accessory/Regulatory protein-specific responses were associated with higher viremia. Increasing breadth of Gag-specific responses was associated with decreasing viremia and increasing Env breadth with increasing viremia. Association of the specific CD8(+) T-cell response with low viremia was independent of HLA type and unrelated to epitope sequence conservation. These population-based data, suggesting the existence of both effective immune responses and responses lacking demonstrable biological impact in chronic HIV infection, are of relevance to HIV vaccine design and evaluation.},

abstract = {Traditionally, T cell epitope discovery requires considerable amounts of tedious, slow, and costly experimental work. During the last decade, prediction tools have emerged as essential tools allowing researchers to select a manageable list of epitope candidates to test from a larger peptide, protein, or even proteome. However, no current tools address the complexity caused by the highly polymorphic nature of the restricting HLA molecules, which effectively individualizes T cell responses. To fill this gap, we here present an easy-to-use prediction tool named HLArestrictor ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HLArestrictor ), which is based on the highly versatile and accurate NetMHCpan predictor, which here has been optimized for the identification of both the MHC restriction element and the corresponding minimal epitope of a T cell response in a given individual. As input, it requires high-resolution (i.e., 4-digit) HLA typing of the individual. HLArestrictor then predicts all 8-11mer peptide binders within one or more larger peptides and provides an overview of the predicted HLA restrictions and minimal epitopes. The method was tested on a large dataset of HIV IFN$\gamma$ ELIspot peptide responses and was shown to identify HLA restrictions and minimal epitopes for about 90{\%} of the positive peptide/patient pairs while rejecting more than 95{\%} of the negative peptide-HLA pairs. Furthermore, for 18 peptide/HLA tetramer validated responses, HLArestrictor in all cases predicted both the HLA restriction element and minimal epitope. Thus, HLArestrictor should be a valuable tool in any T cell epitope discovery process aimed at identifying new epitopes from infectious diseases and other disease models.},

abstract = {T-lymphocytes recognize short peptide antigens bound stably to polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded glycoproteins expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC). Two general pathways have evolved to generate peptide-MHC complexes. The MHC class II antigen processing pathway provides a mechanism for sampling proteins present in endosomal compartments. CD4+ regulatory T-cells recognize peptides bound to MHC class II molecules, which are selectively expressed in specialized APC that have efficient mechanisms for uptake of microbial antigens, and express costimulatory molecules required for activating naive T-cells. CD8+ T-cells recognize peptides bound to MHC class I molecules. Class I molecules are widely expressed and bind peptides derived from the normal turnover of cellular proteins, providing a mechanism to display a sampling of cellular components to be monitored for abnormalities by cytotoxic T-cells. Specialized accessory proteins influence the efficiency of antigen presentation and the specificity of immune responses through their roles in generating peptides, targeting antigen and MHC glycoproteins to selected intracellular compartments, and by direct participation in the peptide-loading mechanism. It has recently been discovered that some viruses have evolved ways to inhibit or subvert discrete steps in antigen processing, providing a mechanism to evade immune recognition.},

Although this is a relatively small proportion of the global pandemic, the remarkable mix of ancestries in the United States, drawn together over the past two centuries of continuous population migrations, provides an important and unique perspective on adaptive interactions between HIV-1 and human genetic diversity. HIV-1 is a rapidly adaptable organism and mutates within or near immune epitopes that are determined by the HLA class I genotype of the infected host. We characterized HLA-associated polymorphisms across the full HIV-1 proteome in a large, ethnically diverse national United States cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals. We found a striking divergence in the immunoselection patterns associated with HLA variants that have very similar or identical peptide-binding specificities but are differentially distributed among racial/ethnic groups. Although their similarity in peptide binding functionally clusters these HLA variants into supertypes, their differences at sites within the peptide-binding groove contribute to race-specific selection effects on circulating HIV-1 viruses. This suggests that the interactions between the HLA/HIV peptide complex and the TCR vary significantly within HLA supertype groups, which, in turn, influences HIV-1 evolution.},

The great diversity of these antigen-binding molecules confers differential advantages in responding to pathogens, but presents a major obstacle to distinguishing HLA allele-specific effects. HLA class I supertypes provide a functional classification for the many different HLA alleles that overlap in their peptide-binding specificities. We analyzed the association of these discrete HLA supertypes with HIV disease progression rates in a population of HIV-infected men. We found that HLA supertypes alone and in combination conferred a strong differential advantage in responding to HIV infection, independent of the contribution of single HLA alleles that associate with progression of the disease. The correlation of the frequency of the HLA supertypes with viral load suggests that HIV adapts to the most frequent alleles in the population, providing a selective advantage for those individuals who express rare alleles.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The development of epitope-based vaccines crucially relies on the ability to classify Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules into sets that have similar peptide binding specificities, termed supertypes. In their seminal work, Sette and Sidney defined nine HLA class I supertypes and claimed that these provide an almost perfect coverage of the entire repertoire of HLA class I molecules. HLA alleles are highly polymorphic and polygenic and therefore experimentally classifying each of these molecules to supertypes is at present an impossible task. Recently, a number of computational methods have been proposed for this task. These methods are based on defining protein similarity measures, derived from analysis of binding peptides or from analysis of the proteins themselves. RESULTS: In this paper we define both peptide derived and protein derived similarity measures, which are based on learning distance functions. The peptide derived measure is defined using a peptide-peptide distance function, which is learned using information about known binding and non-binding peptides. The protein derived similarity measure is defined using a protein-protein distance function, which is learned using information about alleles previously classified to supertypes by Sette and Sidney (1999). We compare the classification obtained by these two complimentary methods to previously suggested classification methods. In general, our results are in excellent agreement with the classifications suggested by Sette and Sidney (1999) and with those reported by Buus et al. (2004). The main important advantage of our proposed distance-based approach is that it makes use of two different and important immunological sources of information-HLA alleles and peptides that are known to bind or not bind to these alleles. Since each of our distance measures is trained using a different source of information, their combination can provide a more confident classification of alleles to supertypes.},

These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies.},

abstract = {The ability to engineer the mouse genome has profoundly transformed biomedical research. During the last decade, conventional transgenic and gene knockout technologies have become invaluable experimental tools for modeling genetic disorders, assigning functions to genes, evaluating drugs and toxins, and by and large helping to answer fundamental questions in basic and applied research. In addition, the growing demand for more sophisticated murine models has also become increasingly evident. Good state-of-principle knowledge about the enormous potential of second-generation conditional mouse technology will be beneficial for any researcher interested in using these experimental tools. In this review we will focus on practice, pivotal principles, and progress in the rapidly expanding area of conditional mouse technology. The review will also present an internet compilation of available tetracycline-inducible mouse models as tools for biomedical research (http://www.zmg.uni-mainz.de/tetmouse/).},

abstract = {Explanted mouse blastocysts were microinjected in the blastocoel cavity with simian virus 40 (SV40) viral DNA. After surgical transfer to the uteri of pseudopregnant surrogate mothers, approximately 40{\%} of the blastocysts developed to term and became healthy adults without apparent tumors at 1 year of age. Molecular hybridization tests for the presence of SV40-specific DNA sequences were conducted on DNA extracted from various organs of these animals. Between 0.5 and 13 SV40 genome equivalents per diploid mouse DNA value were found in some organs of approximately 40{\%} of the adult survivors; this represents a substantial augmentation of the amount administered per embryo. The results are consistent with the working hypothesis that the SV40 DNA may have been integrated into the host genome; alternatively, the viral DNA may have replicated as an extrachromosomal entity or by lytic infection in a few permissive cells. Persistence of the viral DNA from preimplantation stages to adult life may thus provide a new tool for experimental investigation of vertical transmission and expression of tumor viruses.},

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available.},

abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30{\%} identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Prediction of which peptides will bind a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) constitutes an important step in identifying potential T-cell epitopes suitable as vaccine candidates. MHC class II binding peptides have a broad length distribution complicating such predictions. Thus, identifying the correct alignment is a crucial part of identifying the core of an MHC class II binding motif. In this context, we wish to describe a novel Gibbs motif sampler method ideally suited for recognizing such weak sequence motifs. The method is based on the Gibbs sampling method, and it incorporates novel features optimized for the task of recognizing the binding motif of MHC classes I and II. The method locates the binding motif in a set of sequences and characterizes the motif in terms of a weight-matrix. Subsequently, the weight-matrix can be applied to identifying effectively potential MHC binding peptides and to guiding the process of rational vaccine design. RESULTS: We apply the motif sampler method to the complex problem of MHC class II binding. The input to the method is amino acid peptide sequences extracted from the public databases of SYFPEITHI and MHCPEP and known to bind to the MHC class II complex HLA-DR4(B1*0401). Prior identification of information-rich (anchor) positions in the binding motif is shown to improve the predictive performance of the Gibbs sampler. Similarly, a consensus solution obtained from an ensemble average over suboptimal solutions is shown to outperform the use of a single optimal solution. In a large-scale benchmark calculation, the performance is quantified using relative operating characteristics curve (ROC) plots and we make a detailed comparison of the performance with that of both the TEPITOPE method and a weight-matrix derived using the conventional alignment algorithm of ClustalW. The calculation demonstrates that the predictive performance of the Gibbs sampler is higher than that of ClustalW and in most cases also higher than that of the TEPITOPE method.},

The predictions are based on artificial neural networks trained on data from 55 MHC alleles (43 Human and 12 non-human), and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for additional 67 HLA alleles.

This review presents an overview of strategies that employ computer algorithms for the selection of candidate peptides from defined proteins and subsequent verification of their in vivo relevance by experimental approaches. Several computer algorithms are currently being used for epitope prediction of various major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, based either on the analysis of natural MHC ligands or on the binding properties of synthetic peptides. Moreover, the analysis of proteasomal digests of peptides and whole proteins has led to the development of algorithms for the prediction of proteasomal cleavages. In order to verify the generation of the predicted peptides during antigen processing in vivo as well as their immunogenic potential, several experimental approaches have been pursued in the recent past. Mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical approaches have been used specifically to detect predicted peptides among isolated natural ligands. Other strategies employ various methods for the stimulation of primary T cell responses against the predicted peptides and subsequent testing of the recognition pattern towards target cells that express the antigen.},

abstract = {An altered pattern of epigenetic modifications is central to many common human diseases, including cancer. Many studies have explored the mosaic patterns of DNA methylation and histone modification in cancer cells on a gene-by-gene basis; among their results has been the seminal finding of transcriptional silencing of tumour-suppressor genes by CpG-island-promoter hypermethylation. However, recent technological advances are now allowing cancer epigenetics to be studied genome-wide - an approach that has already begun to provide both biological insight and new avenues for translational research. It is time to 'upgrade' cancer epigenetics research and put together an ambitious plan to tackle the many unanswered questions in this field using epigenomics approaches.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Gene copy number and DNA methylation alterations are key regulators of gene expression in cancer. Accordingly, genes that show simultaneous methylation, copy number and expression alterations are likely to have a key role in tumor progression. We have implemented a novel software package (CNAmet) for integrative analysis of high-throughput copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data. To demonstrate the utility of CNAmet, we use copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data from 50 glioblastoma multiforme and 188 ovarian cancer primary tumor samples. Our results reveal a synergistic effect of DNA methylation and copy number alterations on gene expression for several known oncogenes as well as novel candidate oncogenes.
