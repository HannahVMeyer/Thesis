It covered not only Mendelism but evolution, natural selection, biometry, mutation, and cytology. It ran to five editions but was, despite its success, largely forgotten following Lock's early death in 1915. Nevertheless it was the book that inspired H. J. Muller to do genetics and was remembered by A. H. Sturtevant as the source of the earliest suggestion that linkage might be related to the exchange of parts between homologous chromosomes.

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have helped to shed light on the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. Deep phenotyping of population cohorts is increasingly applied, where multi- to high-dimensional phenotypes are recorded in the individuals. Whilst these rich datasets provide important opportunities to analyse complex trait structures and pleiotropic effects at a genome-wide scale, existing statistical methods for joint genetic analyses are hampered by computational limitations posed by high-dimensional phenotypes. Consequently, such multivariate analyses are currently limited to a moderate number of traits. Here, we introduce a method that combines linear mixed models with bootstrapping (LiMMBo) to enable computationally efficient joint genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotypes. Our method builds on linear mixed models, thereby providing robust control for population structure and other confounding factors, and the model scales to larger datasets with up to hundreds of phenotypes. We first validate LiMMBo using simulations, demonstrating consistent covariance estimates at greatly reduced computational cost compared to existing methods. We also find LiMMBo yields consistent power advantages compared to univariate modelling strategies, where the advantages of multivariate mapping increases substantially with the phenotype dimensionality. Finally, we applied LiMMBo to 41 yeast growth traits to map their genetic determinants, finding previously known and novel pleiotropic relationships in this high-dimensional phenotype space. LiMMBo is accessible as open source software (https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/limmbo).},

@article{Schor2017,
abstract = {TSSs are defined by the core promoter, a complex DNA element that facilitates recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) 1–3 in addition to providing specificity for interactions with particular enhancers 4–10 . Methods such as cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) 11,12 map TSS posi-tion at single-nucleotide resolution and provide a global view of TSS distribution within a promoter 11,13,14 . This has led to the clas-sification of animal promoters into two major types 3,15 . Narrow pro-moters, typical of genes with restricted tissue-specific expression, are often associated with positioned motifs such as the TATA box or initiator (Inr), and have a single predominant TSS. Broad promoters, typical of ubiquitously expressed genes, have more dispersed patterns of transcriptional initiation and do not contain a TATA box 16–19 . Broad promoters were initially associated with mammalian CpG island promoters 11 but later found to be common in Drosophila 20,21 , indicating that they function independently of the CpG island itself. Broad and narrow promoters also have differences in the positioning and histone modifications of the first nucleosome downstream of the promoter 22–24 , suggesting different regulatory mechanisms. Although both promoter classes are found in organisms ranging from flies to humans 11,14,23 , their inherent functional differences are not understood. Cross-species studies indicate that promoter shape is generally conserved 11,25 , suggesting functional importance, yet the natural variability of promoter shape within populations and its genetic determinants and evolutionary constraints are unknown. Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human 26–28 and model systems 29–32 have identified extensive functional genetic variants in the vicinity of promoters that affect transcript abun-dance. This suggests that natural sequence variation within a highly polymorphic species such as Drosophila melanogaster could also be used as a perturbation tool to gain mechanistic insights into pro-moter function by testing for associations with complex molecular readouts. Following this rationale, we used CAGE 12,33 sequencing across a panel of 81 Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines to investi-gate genetic effects on 5′ transcriptional initiation at single-base-pair resolution during embryonic development. Mapping TSS-associated QTLs (tssQTLs) using CAGE-derived phenotypes highlighted three types of associations: variants affecting transcript abundance (either promoter strength or transcript turnover), variants affecting pro-moter shape (a new genetic trait), or variants affecting both. Genetic variants primarily associated with promoter shape are located within the core promoter region itself. Using a single-cell quantitative assay combined with promoter engineering, we found that tssQTLs affect-ing promoter shape typically increase expression noise. In their natu-ral sequence context, this noise effect was often buffered by other variants within the promoter, suggesting that promoter shape–asso-ciated variants, although frequent, are found only in specific allelic combinations. Taken together, our results identify promoter shape as a genetically controlled molecular trait with important implications for both promoter function and evolution. Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise},

abstract = {Due to the increasing power of personal computers, as well as the availability of flexible forward-time simulation programs like simuPOP, it is now possible to simulate the evolution of complex human diseases using a forward-time approach. This approach is potentially more powerful than the coalescent approach since it allows simulations of more than one disease susceptibility locus using almost arbitrary genetic and demographic models. However, the application of such simulations has been deterred by the lack of a suitable simulation framework. For example, it is not clear when and how to introduce disease mutants-especially those under purifying selection-to an evolving population, and how to control the disease allele frequencies at the last generation. In this paper, we introduce a forward-time simulation framework that allows us to generate large multi-generation populations with complex diseases caused by unlinked disease susceptibility loci, according to specified demographic and evolutionary properties. Unrelated individuals, small or large pedigrees can be drawn from the resulting population and provide samples for a wide range of study designs and ascertainment methods. We demonstrate our simulation framework using three examples that map genes associated with affection status, a quantitative trait, and the age of onset of a hypothetical cancer, respectively. Nonadditive fitness models, population structure, and gene-gene interactions are simulated. Case-control, sibpair, and large pedigree samples are drawn from the simulated populations and are examined by a variety of gene-mapping methods.},

@article{Carvajal-Rodriguez2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND There are several situations in population biology research where simulating DNA sequences is useful. Simulation of biological populations under different evolutionary genetic models can be undertaken using backward or forward strategies. Backward simulations, also called coalescent-based simulations, are computationally efficient. The reason is that they are based on the history of lineages with surviving offspring in the current population. On the contrary, forward simulations are less efficient because the entire population is simulated from past to present. However, the coalescent framework imposes some limitations that forward simulation does not. Hence, there is an increasing interest in forward population genetic simulation and efficient new tools have been developed recently. Software tools that allow efficient simulation of large DNA fragments under complex evolutionary models will be very helpful when trying to better understand the trace left on the DNA by the different interacting evolutionary forces. Here I will introduce GenomePop, a forward simulation program that fulfills the above requirements. The use of the program is demonstrated by studying the impact of intracodon recombination on global and site-specific dN/dS estimation. RESULTS I have developed algorithms and written software to efficiently simulate, forward in time, different Markovian nucleotide or codon models of DNA mutation. Such models can be combined with recombination, at inter and intra codon levels, fitness-based selection and complex demographic scenarios. CONCLUSION GenomePop has many interesting characteristics for simulating SNPs or DNA sequences under complex evolutionary and demographic models. These features make it unique with respect to other simulation tools. Namely, the possibility of forward simulation under General Time Reversible (GTR) mutation or GTRxMG94 codon models with intra-codon recombination, arbitrary, user-defined, migration patterns, diploid or haploid models, constant or variable population sizes, etc. It also allows simulation of fitness-based selection under different distributions of mutational effects. Under the 2-allele model it allows the simulation of recombination hot-spots, the definition of different frequencies in different populations, etc. GenomePop can also manage large DNA fragments. In addition, it has a scaling option to save computation time when simulating large sequences and population sizes under complex demographic and evolutionary situations. These and many other features are detailed in its web page [1].},

Backward-in-time simulation methods are computationally efficient and have become widely used since their introduction in the 1980s. The forward-in-time approach has substantial advantages in terms of accuracy and modeling flexibility, but at greater computational cost. We have developed flexible and efficient simulation software and a rescaling technique to aid computational efficiency that together allow the simulation of sequence-level data over large genomic regions in entire diploid populations under various scenarios for demography, mutation, selection, and recombination, the latter including hotspots and gene conversion. Our forward evolution of genomic regions (FREGENE) software is freely available from www.ebi.ac.uk/projects/BARGEN together with an ancillary program to generate phenotype labels, either binary or quantitative.

abstract = {Simulation studies in population genetics play an important role in helping to better understand the impact of various evolutionary and demographic scenarios on sequence variation and sequence patterns, and they also permit investigators to better assess and design analytical methods in the study of disease-associated genetic factors. To facilitate these studies, it is imperative to develop simulators with the capability to accurately generate complex genomic data under various genetic models. Currently, a number of efficient simulation software packages for large-scale genomic data are available, and new simulation programs with more sophisticated capabilities and features continue to emerge. In this article, we review the three basic simulation frameworks--coalescent, forward, and resampling--and some of the existing simulators that fall under these frameworks, comparing them with respect to their evolutionary and demographic scenarios, their computational complexity, and their specific applications. Additionally, we address some limitations in current simulation algorithms and discuss future challenges in the development of more powerful simulation tools.},

@article{Xu2014,
abstract = {Although a standard genome-wide significance level has been accepted for the testing of association between common genetic variants and disease, the era of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) requires a new threshold. The allele frequency spectrum of sequence-identified variants is very different from common variants, and the identified rare genetic variation is usually jointly analyzed in a series of genomic windows or regions. In nearby or overlapping windows, these test statistics will be correlated, and the degree of correlation is likely to depend on the choice of window size, overlap, and the test statistic. Furthermore, multiple analyses may be performed using different windows or test statistics. Here we propose an empirical approach for estimating genome-wide significance thresholds for data arising from WGS studies, and we demonstrate that the empirical threshold can be efficiently estimated by extrapolating from calculations performed on a small genomic region. Because analysis of WGS may need to be repeated with different choices of test statistics or windows, this prediction approach makes it computationally feasible to estimate genome-wide significance thresholds for different analysis choices. Based on UK10K whole-genome sequence data, we derive genome-wide significance thresholds ranging between 2.5 × 10(-8) and 8 × 10(-8) for our analytic choices in window-based testing, and thresholds of 0.6 × 10(-8) -1.5 × 10(-8) for a combined analytic strategy of testing common variants using single-SNP tests together with rare variants analyzed with our sliding-window test strategy.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

abstract = {The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium was set up to analyze brain measures and genotypes from multiple sites across the world to improve the power to detect genetic variants that influence the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common genetic variants may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. DTI measures, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying genetic variants that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI working group, we analyzed high-resolution FA images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18-85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized FA image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived FA measures. We show that our template is reliable for integrating multiple datasets by combining results through meta-analysis and unifying the data through exploratory mega-analyses. Our results may help prioritize regions of the FA map that are consistently influenced by additive genetic factors for future genetic discovery studies. Protocols and templates are publicly available at (http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-working-group/).},

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

abstract = {The classic variance components for simple polygenic traits - additive, dominance, and environmental variance - have traditionally been estimated from sample covariances between first-degree relatives. If data is gathered on pedigrees, this statistical procedure wastes information. Recently Elston {\&} Stewart suggested an alternative likelihood procedure that uses all the information in a set of pedigrees. A refinement of their method based on the scoring technique gives rapidly converging maximum likelihood estimates of the variance components and of the male and female means. Tests of statistical hypotheses about the various parameters can then be made by the likelihood ratio method. Furthermore, using classical regression analysis, the estimated parameter values allow prediction of unknown trait values from known trait values within a pedigree. These methods should apply to traits like total finger ridge count and to quantitative measurements associated with disease traits. Since the model postulates independent environmental effects and no assortative mating, its utility in human behaviour genetics seems limited.},

We present a method for detection of recent IBD in population samples. Our method accounts for linkage disequilibrium between SNPs to enable full use of high-density SNP data. We find that our method can detect segments of a length of 2 cM with moderate power and negligible false discovery rate in Illumina 550K data in Northwestern Europeans. We compare our method with GERMLINE and PLINK, and we show that our method has a level of resolution that is significantly better than these existing methods, thus extending the usefulness of recent IBD in analysis of high-density SNP data. We survey four genomic regions in a sample of UK individuals of European descent and find that on average, at a given location, our method detects IBD in 2.7 per 10,000 pairs of individuals in Illumina 550K data. We also present methodology and results for detection of homozygosity by descent (HBD) and survey the whole genome in a sample of 1373 UK individuals of European descent. We detect HBD in 4.7 individuals per 10,000 on average at a given location. Our methodology is implemented in the freely available BEAGLE software package.},

Existing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods sample descent patterns on pedigrees conditional on observed marker data. These patterns can be stored as IBD graphs, which express shared ancestry only, rather than specific family relationships. A model for IBD between unrelated individuals allows the estimation of coancestry between individuals in different pedigrees. IBD graphs on separate pedigrees can then be combined using these estimates. We report results from analyses of three sets of simulated marker data on two different pedigrees. We show that when families share a gene for a trait due to shared ancestry on the order of tens of generations, our method can detect a linkage signal when independent analyses of the families do not.},

A recent study in which {\textgreater}350 microsatellites were studied in a global sample of humans showed that they could be grouped according to their continental origin, and this was widely interpreted as evidence for a discrete distribution of human genetic diversity. Here, we investigate how study design can influence such conclusions. Our results show that when individuals are sampled homogeneously from around the globe, the pattern seen is one of gradients of allele frequencies that extend over the entire world, rather than discrete clusters. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that major genetic discontinuities exist between different continents or "races."},

abstract = {Although several genes have been implicated in the development of the early-onset autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the genetics of late-onset AD (LOAD) is complex. Loci on several chromosomes have been linked to the disease, but so far only the apolipoprotein E gene has been consistently shown to be a risk factor. We have performed a large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association study, across the region of linkage on chromosome 12, in multiple case-control series totaling 1,089 LOAD patients and 1,196 control subjects and report association with SNPs in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) gene. Subsequent analysis of GAPD paralogs on other chromosomes demonstrated association with two other paralogs. A significant association between LOAD and a compound genotype of the three GAPD genes was observed in all three sample sets. Individually, these SNPs make differential contributions to disease risk in each of the casecontrol series, suggesting that variants in functionally similar genes may account for series-to-series heterogeneity of disease risk. Our observations raise the possibility that GAPD genes are AD risk factors, a hypothesis that is consistent with the role of GAPD in neuronal apoptosis.},

abstract = {Emotional resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain healthy and stable levels of psychological functioning in the wake of stress and trauma. Although genes that contribute to psychopathology (often in interaction with environmental stressors) are being detected with increasing consistency, genes that influence resilience to stress have been less studied. In this study, 423 undergraduate college students completed a psychometrically sound 10-item self-report measure of resilience (CDRISC-10) and provided blood for DNA. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to model relationships between the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) and CDRISC-10 scores and categories, respectively. CDRISC-10 scores were normally distributed (mean 26.17, SD 5.88 [range 5-40]). In models adjusting for ancestry proportion scores (to mitigate confounding by population stratification) and other covariates, each copy of the "s" allele of 5HTTLPR was associated with approximately 1-point lower CDRISC-10 score. Each copy of the "s" allele was associated with increased (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95{\%} CI 1.06-2.21, P = 0.024) odds of being in the low resilient category ({\textgreater}1 SD below the mean), compared to being homozygous for the "l" allele. These findings suggest that variation in 5HTTLPR is associated with individual differences in emotional resilience, defined as an individual's ability to withstand and bounce back from stress. This relationship may explain the frequently observed interaction between 5HTTLPR and life stressors in predicting adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms). Replication is needed, in concert with identification of other genes that influence emotional resilience and related phenotypes.},

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina equine SNP50 bead chip was performed to identify loci conferring risk to ERU. The sample included a total of 144 German warmblood horses. A GWAS showed a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on horse chromosome (ECA) 20 at 49.3 Mb, with IL-17A and IL-17F being the closest genes. This locus explained a fraction of 23{\%} of the phenotypic variance for ERU. A GWAS taking into account the severity of ERU, revealed a SNP on ECA18 nearby to the crystalline gene cluster CRYGA-CRYGF. For both genomic regions on ECA18 and 20, significantly associated haplotypes containing the genome-wide significant SNPs could be demonstrated. In conclusion, our results are indicative for a genetic component regulating the possible critical role of IL-17A and IL-17F in the pathogenesis of ERU. The associated SNP on ECA18 may be indicative for cataract formation in the course of ERU.},

abstract = {GWAS have emerged as popular tools for identifying genetic variants that are associated with disease risk. Standard analysis of a case-control GWAS involves assessing the association between each individual genotyped SNP and disease risk. However, this approach suffers from limited reproducibility and difficulties in detecting multi-SNP and epistatic effects. As an alternative analytical strategy, we propose grouping SNPs together into SNP sets on the basis of proximity to genomic features such as genes or haplotype blocks, then testing the joint effect of each SNP set. Testing of each SNP set proceeds via the logistic kernel-machine-based test, which is based on a statistical framework that allows for flexible modeling of epistatic and nonlinear SNP effects. This flexibility and the ability to naturally adjust for covariate effects are important features of our test that make it appealing in comparison to individual SNP tests and existing multimarker tests. Using simulated data based on the International HapMap Project, we show that SNP-set testing can have improved power over standard individual-SNP analysis under a wide range of settings. In particular, we find that our approach has higher power than individual-SNP analysis when the median correlation between the disease-susceptibility variant and the genotyped SNPs is moderate to high. When the correlation is low, both individual-SNP analysis and the SNP-set analysis tend to have low power. We apply SNP-set analysis to analyze the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) breast cancer GWAS discovery-phase data.},

abstract = {Association or linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based mapping strategies are receiving increased attention for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in plants as an alternative to more traditional, purely linkage-based approaches. An attractive property of association approaches is that they do not require specially designed crosses between inbred parents, but can be applied to collections of genotypes with arbitrary and often unknown relationships between the genotypes. A less obvious additional attractive property is that association approaches offer possibilities for QTL identification in crops with hard to model segregation patterns. The availability of candidate genes and targeted marker systems facilitates association approaches, as will appropriate methods of analysis. We propose an association mapping approach based on mixed models with attention to the incorporation of the relationships between genotypes, whether induced by pedigree, population substructure, or otherwise. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to pay attention to the environmental features of the data as well, i.e., adequate representation of the relations among multiple observations on the same genotypes. We illustrate our modeling approach using 25 years of Dutch national variety list data on late blight resistance in the genetically complex crop of potato. As markers, we used nucleotide binding-site markers, a specific type of marker that targets resistance or resistance-analog genes. To assess the consistency of QTL identified by our mixed-model approach, a second independent data set was analyzed. Two markers were identified that are potentially useful in selection for late blight resistance in potato.},

In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM {\textless}2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM(2.5) exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality from coronary heart disease in the United States has decreased substantially in recent decades. We conducted a study to determine how much of this decrease could be explained by the use of medical and surgical treatments as opposed to changes in cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS We applied a previously validated statistical model, IMPACT, to data on the use and effectiveness of specific cardiac treatments and on changes in risk factors between 1980 and 2000 among U.S. adults 25 to 84 years old. The difference between the observed and expected number of deaths from coronary heart disease in 2000 was distributed among the treatments and risk factors included in the analyses. RESULTS From 1980 through 2000, the age-adjusted death rate for coronary heart disease fell from 542.9 to 266.8 deaths per 100,000 population among men and from 263.3 to 134.4 deaths per 100,000 population among women, resulting in 341,745 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease in 2000. Approximately 47{\%} of this decrease was attributed to treatments, including secondary preventive therapies after myocardial infarction or revascularization (11{\%}), initial treatments for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina (10{\%}), treatments for heart failure (9{\%}), revascularization for chronic angina (5{\%}), and other therapies (12{\%}). Approximately 44{\%} was attributed to changes in risk factors, including reductions in total cholesterol (24{\%}), systolic blood pressure (20{\%}), smoking prevalence (12{\%}), and physical inactivity (5{\%}), although these reductions were partially offset by increases in the body-mass index and the prevalence of diabetes, which accounted for an increased number of deaths (8{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Approximately half the decline in U.S. deaths from coronary heart disease from 1980 through 2000 may be attributable to reductions in major risk factors and approximately half to evidence-based medical therapies.},

abstract = {The conduction system of the heart initiates and coordinates the electric signal that causes the rhythmic and synchronized contractions of the atria and ventricles. In higher vertebrates, this system comprises the sinuatrial (SAN) and atrioventricular nodes (AVN) and the “wiring” of the ventricles. The latter comprises the atrioventricular bundle (AVB), the left and right bundle branches (BBs), and the peripheral ventricular conduction system (PVCS). Failure in the function of the nodes or bundles leads to arrhythmias, requiring electronic pacemaker implantation. On the other side, ectopic pacemaker or conductive activity may cause arrhythmias requiring intervention. Recent progress in molecular-genetic and developmental biology has lead to novel insights into the processes underlying the formation of the conduction system. These insights provide a framework that helps to understand pathologies of the conduction system. In this review, we focus on the cellular origin of the conduction system components, the molecular-genetic mechanisms that control their differentiation, and their impact on arrhythmias. The distinct components of the cardiac conduction system of the heart are essentially myocardial (Figure 1).1–4 The hypothesis that the conduction system may have a neural crest origin has not been supported by evidence. Retroviral labeled single cardiac cells of the early embryonic chicken heart (HH15-17, ±30 somites) were found to give rise to multicellular clones containing both working myocardium and myocardial cells of the conduction system.5,6 Moreover, in both chicken and mouse, labeled neural crest or proepicardial cells were never traced in the conduction system components, even though their descendants were found in close association with these components.6 Figure 1.

Abnormal impulse initiation or propagation can result in brady- and tachy-arrhythmias, producing an array of symptoms, including syncope, heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Underlying the functional diversity of the CCS are gene regulatory networks that direct cell fate towards a nodal or a fast conduction gene program.

Given the complex nature of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis, it is not surprising that some form of congenital heart disease is present in ≈1 percent of newborns.

This has been driven in large part by an interest in understanding the causes of congenital heart disease coupled with the potential of using knowledge from developmental biology to generate functional cells and tissues that could be used for regenerative medicine purposes. In this review, we highlight the critical signaling pathways and transcription factor networks that regulate cardiomyocyte lineage specification in both in vivo and in vitro models.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study examined the relations of echocardiographically determined left ventricular (LV) mass and hypertrophy to the risk of sudden death. BACKGROUND Echocardiographic LV hypertrophy is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about the association of echocardiographic LV hypertrophy with sudden death. METHODS We examined the relations of LV mass and hypertrophy to the incidence of sudden death in 3,661 subjects enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study who were {\textgreater} or =40 years of age. The baseline examination was performed from 1979 to 1983 and LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass (adjusted for height) {\textgreater} 143 g/m in men and {\textgreater} 102 g/m in women. During up to 14 years of follow-up there were 60 sudden deaths. Cox models examined the relations of LV mass and LV hypertrophy to sudden death risk after adjusting for known risk factors. RESULTS The prevalence of LV hypertrophy was 21.5{\%}. The risk factor-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for sudden death was 1.45 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.92, p=0.008) for each 50-g/m increment in LV mass. For LV hypertrophy, the risk factor-adjusted HR for sudden death was 2.16 (95{\%} CI 1.22 to 3.81, p=0.008). After excluding the first 4 years of follow-up, both increased LV mass and LV hypertrophy conferred long-term risk of sudden death (HR 1.53, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 2.28, p=0.047 and HR 3.28, 95{\%} CI 1.58 to 6.83, p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Increased LV mass and hypertrophy are associated with increased risk for sudden death after accounting for known risk factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Data are limited on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD). Moreover, it is not known whether genetic variants identified to date also associate with risk of CHD in a prospective setting. METHODS We performed a two-stage GWAS analysis of incident myocardial infarction (MI) and CHD in a total of 64,297 individuals (including 3898 MI cases, 5465 CHD cases). SNPs that passed an arbitrary threshold of 5×10-6 in Stage I were taken to Stage II for further discovery. Furthermore, in an analysis of prognosis, we studied whether known SNPs from former GWAS were associated with total mortality in individuals who experienced MI during follow-up. RESULTS In Stage I 15 loci passed the threshold of 5×10-6; 8 loci for MI and 8 loci for CHD, for which one locus overlapped and none were reported in previous GWAS meta-analyses. We took 60 SNPs representing these 15 loci to Stage II of discovery. Four SNPs near QKI showed nominally significant association with MI (p-value{\textless}8.8×10-3) and three exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold when Stage I and Stage II results were combined (top SNP rs6941513: p = 6.2×10-9). Despite excellent power, the 9p21 locus SNP (rs1333049) was only modestly associated with MI (HR = 1.09, p-value = 0.02) and marginally with CHD (HR = 1.06, p-value = 0.08). Among an inception cohort of those who experienced MI during follow-up, the risk allele of rs1333049 was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent mortality (HR = 0.90, p-value = 3.2×10-3). CONCLUSIONS QKI represents a novel locus that may serve as a predictor of incident CHD in prospective studies. The association of the 9p21 locus both with increased risk of first myocardial infarction and longer survival after MI highlights the importance of study design in investigating genetic determinants of complex disorders.},

abstract = {The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium was set up to analyze brain measures and genotypes from multiple sites across the world to improve the power to detect genetic variants that influence the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common genetic variants may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. DTI measures, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying genetic variants that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI working group, we analyzed high-resolution FA images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18-85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized FA image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived FA measures. We show that our template is reliable for integrating multiple datasets by combining results through meta-analysis and unifying the data through exploratory mega-analyses. Our results may help prioritize regions of the FA map that are consistently influenced by additive genetic factors for future genetic discovery studies. Protocols and templates are publicly available at (http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu/ongoing/dti-working-group/).},

abstract = {Disease association with a genetic marker is often taken as a preliminary indication of linkage with disease sus-ceptibility. However, population subdivision and ad-mixture may lead to disease association even in the ab-sence of linkage. In a previous paper, we described a test for linkage (and linkage disequilibrium) between a genetic marker and disease susceptibility; linkage is detected by this test only if association is also present. This transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) is carried out with data on transmission of marker alleles from parents heterozygous for the marker to affected off-spring. The TDT is a valid test for linkage and associa-tion, even when the association is caused by population subdivision and admixture. In the previous paper, we did not explicitly consider the effect of recent history on population structure. Here we extend the previous re-sults by examining in detail the effects of subdivision and admixture, viewed as processes in population his-tory. We describe two models for these processes. For both models, we analyze the properties of (a) the TDT as a test for linkage (and association) between marker and disease and (b) the conventional contingency statis-tic used with family data to test for population associa-tion. We show that the contingency test statistic does not have a x2 distribution if subdivision or admixture is present. In contrast, the TDT remains a valid x2 statis-tic for the linkage hypothesis, regardless of population history.},

Four major approaches have been developed: linkage analysis, allele-sharing methods, association studies, and polygenic analysis of experimental crosses.

Haplotypes can be obtained, at considerable cost, experimentally or (partially) through genotyping of additional family members. Alternatively, a statistical method can be used to infer phase and to reconstruct haplotypes. We present a new statistical method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci from a population sample, that improves substantially on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, relative to its nearest competitor. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well in absolute terms, suggesting that reconstructing haplotypes experimentally or by genotyping additional family members may be an inefficient use of resources.},

abstract = {In the analysis of complex traits, genetic effects can be confounded with non-genetic effects, especially when using full-sib families. Dominance and epistatic effects are typically confounded with additive genetic and non-genetic effects. This confounding may cause the estimated genetic variance components to be inaccurate and biased. In this study, we constructed genetic covariance structures from whole-genome marker data, and thus used realized relationship matrices to estimate variance components in a heterogenous population of {\~{}} 2200 mice for which four complex traits were investigated. These mice were genotyped for more than 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the variances due to family, cage and genetic effects were estimated by models based on pedigree information only, aggregate SNP information, and model selection for specific SNP effects. We show that the use of genome-wide SNP information can disentangle confounding factors to estimate genetic variances by separating genetic and non-genetic effects. The estimated variance components using realized relationship were more accurate and less biased, compared to those based on pedigree information only. Models that allow the selection of individual SNP in addition to fitting a relationship matrix are more efficient for traits with a significant dominance variance.},

@article{Lopes2013,
abstract = {Traditional breeding programs consider an average pairwise kinship between sibs. Based on pedigree information, the relationship matrix is used for genetic evaluations disregarding variation due to Mendelian sampling. Therefore, inbreeding and kinship coefficients are either over or underestimated resulting in reduction of accuracy of genetic evaluations and genetic progress. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) can be used to estimate pairwise kinship and individual inbreeding more accurately. The aim of this study was to optimize the selection of markers and determine the required number of SNPs for estimation of kinship and inbreeding. A total of 1,565 animals from three commercial pig populations were analyzed for 28,740 SNPs from the PorcineSNP60 Beadchip. Mean genomic inbreeding was higher than pedigree-based estimates in lines 2 and 3, but lower in line 1. As expected, a larger variation of genomic kinship estimates was observed for half and full sibs than for pedigree-based kinship reflecting Mendelian sampling. Genomic kinship between father-offspring pairs was lower (0.23) than the estimate based on pedigree (0.26). Bootstrap analyses using six reduced SNP panels (n = 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000) showed that 2,000 SNPs were able to reproduce the results very close to those obtained using the full set of unlinked markers (n = 7,984-10,235) with high correlations (inbreeding r {\textgreater} 0.82 and kinship r {\textgreater} 0.96) and low variation between different sets with the same number of SNPs. Variation of kinship between sibs due to Mendelian sampling is better captured using genomic information than the pedigree-based method. Therefore, the reduced sets of SNPs could generate more accurate kinship coefficients between sibs than the pedigree-based method. Variation of genomic kinship of father-offspring pairs is recommended as a parameter to determine accuracy of the method rather than correlation with pedigree-based estimates. Inbreeding and kinship coefficients can be estimated with high accuracy using ≥2,000 unlinked SNPs within all three commercial pig lines evaluated. However, a larger number of SNPs might be necessary in other populations or across lines.},

abstract = {Congenital heart defects involving left-sided lesions (LSLs) are relatively common birth defects with substantial morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested a high heritability with a complex genetic architecture, such that only a few LSL loci have been identified. We performed a genome-wide case-control association study to address the role of common variants using a discovery cohort of 778 cases and 2756 controls. We identified a genome-wide significant association mapping to a 200 kb region on chromosome 20q11 [P= 1.72 × 10(-8) for rs3746446; imputed Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) rs6088703 P= 3.01 × 10(-9), odds ratio (OR)= 1.6 for both]. This result was supported by transmission disequilibrium analyses using a subset of 541 case families (lowest P in region= 4.51 × 10(-5), OR= 1.5). Replication in a cohort of 367 LSL cases and 5159 controls showed nominal association (P= 0.03 for rs3746446) resulting in P= 9.49 × 10(-9) for rs3746446 upon meta-analysis of the combined cohorts. In addition, a group of seven SNPs on chromosome 1q21.3 met threshold for suggestive association (lowest P= 9.35 × 10(-7) for rs12045807). Both regions include genes involved in cardiac development-MYH7B/miR499A on chromosome 20 and CTSK, CTSS and ARNT on chromosome 1. Genome-wide heritability analysis using case-control genotyped SNPs suggested that the mean heritability of LSLs attributable to common variants is moderately high ([Formula: see text] range= 0.26-0.34) and consistent with previous assertions. These results provide evidence for the role of common variation in LSLs, proffer new genes as potential biological candidates, and give further insight to the complex genetic architecture of congenital heart disease.},

Here we develop a high-throughput rice phenotyping facility (HRPF) to monitor 13 traditional agronomic traits and 2 newly defined traits during the rice growth period. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the 15 traits, we identify 141 associated loci, 25 of which contain known genes such as the Green Revolution semi-dwarf gene, SD1. Based on a performance evaluation of the HRPF and GWAS results, we demonstrate that high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to replace traditional phenotyping techniques and can provide valuable gene identification information. The combination of the multifunctional phenotyping tools HRPF and GWAS provides deep insights into the genetic architecture of important traits.},

abstract = {This study investigated, through stochastic computer simulation, the extra gains expected from marker-assisted selection (MAS) in an infinitesimal model with linkage. The trait under selection was assumed to be controlled by 2,000 loci of additive small effect and evenly distributed in c chromosomes of one Morgan each (and c = 5, 10, 20, or 30). This approach differs from previous studies on the benefits of MAS that have considered mixed inheritance models. Marker information was used together with pedigree information to compute the relationship matrix used in BLUP genetic evaluations. The MAS schemes were compared with schemes where genetic evaluations were performed using standard BLUP (i.e., the relationship matrix is obtained using pedigree information only). When the number of markers was large enough (approximately one marker every 10 cM), there were increases in the accuracy of selection with MAS, and this led to extra gains compared with standard BLUP for all genome sizes considered. The benefit from MAS increased over generations. At the last generation of selection (Generation 10), the response from MAS was 11, 9, 7, and 5{\%} greater than with standard BLUP for genomes with 5, 10, 20, and 30 chromosomes, respectively. Thus, although small, gains from MAS were nonetheless detectable for genome sizes typical of livestock populations.},

abstract = {Total allelic relationship (TA) as a possible alternative to the pedigree-derived additive genetic relationship (RA) is defined. The TA measures the actual allelic identity between individuals for loci segregating for the trait concerned. Its value was studied by simulation in populations of different family structure, different numbers of loci, different numbers of alleles per locus, and different heritability levels. The alternative types of relationship matrices were used in mixed model equations to derive best linear unbiased prediction estimates (EBV) of breeding values (BV). Accuracies of evaluations were calculated as correlations of EBV with true breeding values. In populations with random selection and mating, EBVTA derived using TA had higher accuracies than EBVRA derived using RA. In populations with selection, EBVTA was more accurate and resulted in higher responses than selection on EBVRA. We conclude that not accounting for variation in average measures of relationship and identity in state can be important sources of variance of prediction error, and taking account of them increases the accuracy of selection.},

abstract = {Non-normality of the phenotypic distribution can affect power to detect quantitative trait loci in sib pair studies. Previously, we observed that Winsorizing the sib pair phenotypes increased the power of quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection for both Haseman-Elston (HE) least-squares tests [Hum Hered 2002;53:59-67] and maximum likelihood-based variance components (MLVC) analysis [Behav Genet (in press)]. Winsorizing the phenotypes led to a slight increase in type 1 error in H-E tests and a slight decrease in type I error for MLVC analysis. Herein, we considered transforming the sib pair phenotypes using the Box-Cox family of transformations. Data were simulated for normal and non-normal (skewed and kurtic) distributions. Phenotypic values were replaced by Box-Cox transformed values. Twenty thousand replications were performed for three H-E tests of linkage and the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the Wald test and other robust versions based on the MLVC method. We calculated the relative nominal inflation rate as the ratio of observed empirical type 1 error divided by the set alpha level (5, 1 and 0.1{\%} alpha levels). MLVC tests applied to non-normal data had inflated type I errors (rate ratio greater than 1.0), which were controlled best by Box-Cox transformation and to a lesser degree by Winsorizing. For example, for non-transformed, skewed phenotypes (derived from a chi2 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom), the rates of empirical type 1 error with respect to set alpha level=0.01 were 0.80, 4.35 and 7.33 for the original H-E test, LRT and Wald test, respectively. For the same alpha level=0.01, these rates were 1.12, 3.095 and 4.088 after Winsorizing and 0.723, 1.195 and 1.905 after Box-Cox transformation. Winsorizing reduced inflated error rates for the leptokurtic distribution (derived from a Laplace distribution with mean 0 and variance 8). Further, power (adjusted for empirical type 1 error) at the 0.01 alpha level ranged from 4.7 to 17.3{\%} across all tests using the non-transformed, skewed phenotypes, from 7.5 to 20.1{\%} after Winsorizing and from 12.6 to 33.2{\%} after Box-Cox transformation. Likewise, power (adjusted for empirical type 1 error) using leptokurtic phenotypes at the 0.01 alpha level ranged from 4.4 to 12.5{\%} across all tests with no transformation, from 7 to 19.2{\%} after Winsorizing and from 4.5 to 13.8{\%} after Box-Cox transformation. Thus the Box-Cox transformation apparently provided the best type 1 error control and maximal power among the procedures we considered for analyzing a non-normal, skewed distribution (chi2) while Winzorizing worked best for the non-normal, kurtic distribution (Laplace). We repeated the same simulations using a larger sample size (200 sib pairs) and found similar results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a perspective of how inferred relatedness, based on genetic marker data such as microsatellites or amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), can be used to demonstrate quantitative genetic variation in natural populations. Variation at two levels is considered: among pairs of individuals within populations, and among pairs of subpopulations within a population. In the former, inferred pairwise relatedness, combined with trait measures, allow estimates of heritability 'in the wild'. In the latter, estimates of QST are obtained, in the absence of known heritabilities, via estimates of pairwise FST. Estimators of relatedness based on the 'Kronecker operator' are given. Both methods require actual variation of relationship, a rarely studied aspect of population structure, and not necessarily present. Some conditions for appropriate population structures in the wild are identified, in part through a review of recent studies.},

In a comparison with other published estimators of pairwise relatedness, we find these new "regression" estimators to be computationally simpler and to yield similar or lower sampling variances, particularly when many loci are used or when loci are hypervariable. Two examples are given in which the new estimators are applied to natural populations, one that reveals isolation-by-distance in an annual plant and the other that suggests a genetic basis for a coat color polymorphism in bears.},

Numerous methods have been developed to exploit the marker data. These fall into two main categories: method of moment estimators and likelihood estimators. Method of moment estimators are essentially unbiased, but utilise weighting schemes that are only optimal if the analysed pair is unrelated. Thus, they differ in their efficiency at estimating parameters for different relationship categories. Likelihood estimators show smaller mean squared errors but are much more biased. Both types of estimator have been used in variance component analysis to estimate heritability. All marker-based heritability estimators require that adequate levels of the true relationship be present in the population of interest and that adequate amounts of informative marker data are available. I review the different approaches to relationship estimation, with particular attention to optimizing the use of this relationship information in subsequent variance component estimation.},

@article{Hayes2009,
abstract = {Dense marker genotypes allow the construction of the realized relationship matrix between individuals, with elements the realized proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBD) between pairs of individuals. In this paper, we demonstrate that by replacing the average relationship matrix derived from pedigree with the realized relationship matrix in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of breeding values, the accuracy of the breeding values can be substantially increased, especially for individuals with no phenotype of their own. We further demonstrate that this method of predicting breeding values is exactly equivalent to the genomic selection methodology where the effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to variation in the trait are assumed to be normally distributed. The accuracy of breeding values predicted using the realized relationship matrix in the BLUP equations can be deterministically predicted for known family relationships, for example half sibs. The deterministic method uses the effective number of independently segregating loci controlling the phenotype that depends on the type of family relationship and the length of the genome. The accuracy of predicted breeding values depends on this number of effective loci, the family relationship and the number of phenotypic records. The deterministic prediction demonstrates that the accuracy of breeding values can approach unity if enough relatives are genotyped and phenotyped. For example, when 1000 full sibs per family were genotyped and phenotyped, and the heritability of the trait was 0 . 5, the reliability of predicted genomic breeding values (GEBVs) for individuals in the same full sib family without phenotypes was 0 . 82. These results were verified by simulation. A deterministic prediction was also derived for random mating populations, where the effective population size is the key parameter determining the effective number of independently segregating loci. If the effective population size is large, a very large number of individuals must be genotyped and phenotyped in order to accurately predict breeding values for unphenotyped individuals from the same population. If the heritability of the trait is 0 . 3, and N e =1000, approximately 5750 individuals with genotypes and phenotypes are required in order to predict GEBVs of un-phenotyped individuals in the same population with an accuracy of 0 . 7.},

Subjects identified themselves as belonging to one of four major racial/ethnic groups (white, African American, East Asian, and Hispanic) and were recruited from 15 different geographic locales within the United States and Taiwan. Genetic cluster analysis of the microsatellite markers produced four major clusters, which showed near-perfect correspondence with the four self-reported race/ethnicity categories. Of 3,636 subjects of varying race/ethnicity, only 5 (0.14{\%}) showed genetic cluster membership different from their self-identified race/ethnicity. On the other hand, we detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity--as opposed to current residence--is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population. Implications of this genetic structure for case-control association studies are discussed.},

abstract = {The optimal method for considering different genetic models in association studies is not clear. We compared analytical strategies that use different genetic models to analyze genotype-phenotype information from association studies of quantitative traits in unrelated individuals. We created simulated datasets where the minor alleles are causal with an additive, dominant, or recessive mode of inheritance over a range of allele frequencies. We then computed power to detect these causal alleles using one or a combination of statistical models in a standard regression framework, including corrections for the multiple testing incurred by analyzing multiple models. Our results show that, as expected, maximal power is achieved when we test a single genetic model that matches the actual underlying mode of inheritance of the causal allele. When the inheritance pattern of the causal allele is unknown, the co-dominant model, a single two degrees of freedom test, has good overall performance in any of the three simple modes of inheritance simulated. Alternatively, it is slightly more powerful to analyze all three genetic models together (additive, dominant, and recessive), but only if the significance thresholds used to correct for analyzing multiple models are appropriately determined (such as by permutation). Finally, a commonly employed approach, testing the additive model alone, performs poorly for recessive causal alleles when the minor allele frequency is not close to 50{\%}. Our observations were confirmed by analyzing an existing genetic association dataset in which we detect the effect of a KCNJ11 variant on insulinogenic index in unrelated non-diabetic individuals.},

abstract = {In many applications of multiple hypothesis testing where more than one false rejection can be tolerated, procedures controlling error rates measuring at least k false rejections, instead of at least one, for some fixed k ≥ 1 can potentially increase the ability of a procedure to detect false null hypotheses. The k-FWER, a generalized version of the usual familywise error rate (FWER), is such an error rate that has recently been introduced in the literature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. A further generalization of a result on the k-FWER is provided in this article. In addition, an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the k-FDR, is introduced in the same spirit as the k-FWER by generalizing the usual false discovery rate (FDR). A k-FWER procedure is constructed given any set of increasing constants by utilizing the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values without assuming any specific form of dependence among all the p-values. Procedures controlling the k-FDR are also developed by using the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values, first assuming that the sets of null and nonnull p-values are mutually independent or they are jointly positively dependent in the sense of being multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2) and then discarding that assumption about the overall dependence among the p-values.},

abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

@article{Lewontin1960,
abstract = {The joint effects of linkage and epistasis (interaction between non-allelic genes in determining fitness) have been examined for two-locus polymorphisms. The general results are of the following nature: (1) Gene frequencies change toward a stable equilibrium condition which corresponds to a local maximum in mean adaptive value. This change occurs in such a way that the rate of increase of mean adaptive value is not maximum. That is, the trajectory of gene frequency changes is not the "steepest path" on the adaptive surface. (2) In the absence of epistasis, linkage does not affect the final equilibrium of the population. (3) When epistasis is present, linkage must be fairly tight in order for there to be any effect on the final equilibrium. The amount of recombination allowed for such cases is, in general, a function of epistatic deviations. (4) If linkage is tighter than the value demanded by the magnitude of epistatic deviations, there may be permanent linkage disequilibrium of considerable magnitude, and the gene frequencies may also be affected. (5) There are some cases where a stable equilibrium is possible only with a tight linkage. Without such linkage complication, there will be no intermediate gene frequency stable equilibrium. (6) The approach to the equilibrium condition is affected by linkage irrespective of whether there is epistasis although the effect is greater when epistasis is present.},

@article{Sankaranarayanan1998,
abstract = {This paper is focused on baseline frequencies of mendelian diseases and the conceptual basis for calculating doubling doses both of which are relevant for the doubling dose method of estimating genetic risks of exposure of human populations to ionizing radiation. With this method, the risk per unit dose is obtained as a product of three quantities, namely, the baseline frequency of the disease class under consideration, the relative mutation risk (which is the reciprocal of the doubling dose, which in turn, is calculated as a ratio of spontaneous and induction rates of mutations) and mutation component, i.e., the responsiveness of the disease class to an increase in mutation rate. The estimates of baseline frequencies of mendelian diseases that are currently used in risk estimation date back to the late 1970s. Advances in human genetics during the past two decades now permit an upward revision of these estimates. The revised estimates are 150 per 104 livebirths for autosomal dominants (from the earlier estimate of 95 per 104), 75 per 104 livebirths for autosomal recessives (from 25 per 104) and to 15 per 104 livebirths for X-linked diseases (from 5 per 104). The revised total frequency of mendelian diseases is thus 240 per 104 livebirths and is about twice the earlier figure of 125 per 104 livebirths. All these estimates, however, pertain primarily to Western European and Western European-derived populations. The fact that in several population isolates or ethnic groups, some of these diseases (especially the autosomal recessives) are more common as a result of founder effects and/or genetic drift is well known and many more recent examples have come to light. These data are reviewed and illustrated with data from studies of the Ashkenazi Jewish, Finnish, French Canadian, Afrikaner and some other populations to highlight the need for caution in extrapolating radiation risks between populations. The doubling dose of 1 Gy that has been used for the past 20 years for risk estimation is based on mouse data for both spontaneous and induction rates of mutations. In extrapolating the mouse-data-based doubling dose to humans, it is assumed that the spontaneous rates in mice and humans are similar. This assumption is incorrect because of the fact that in humans, for several well-studied mendelian diseases, the mutation rate differs between the two sexes and it increases with paternal age. In estimates of spontaneous mutation rates in humans (which represent averages over both sexes), however, paternal age effects are automatically incorporated. In the mouse, these effects are expected to be much less (if they exist at all), but the problem has not been specifically addressed. The complexities and uncertainties associated with assessing the potential impact of spontaneous mutations which arise as germinal mosaics (and which can result in clusters of mutations in the following generation) on mutation rate estimates (in the mouse) and on mutation rate estimates and disease frequencies (in humans) are discussed. In view of (i) the lack of comparability of spontaneous mutation rates in mice and humans and (ii) the fact that these estimates for human genes already include both paternal age effects and correction for clusters (if they had occurred), it is suggested that a prudent procedure now is to base doubling dose calculations on spontaneous mutation rates of human genes (and induction rates of mouse genes, in the absence of a better alternative). This concept, however, is not new and was used by the US National Academy's Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation in its 1972 report.},

The APOE4 allele increases the probability of disease at an earlier age. In contrasL the APOE3 and APOE2 alleles decrease the probability of disease and increase the age of onset. Therefore the metabolism of apolipoprotein E is relevant to Alzheimer's disease. Isoform-specific interactions of apolipoprotein E with other molecules may determine the rate of disease expression through molecular pathways that appear unique to the disease. In addition, some isoform-specific interactions of apolipoprotein E have been demonstrated with the defining pathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease, the neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque. Several hypotheses of disease pathogenesis are now based on the relevance of apolipoprotein E.},

The distance between the G gamma and A gamma genes is 3.5 kb and that between the A gamma and delta genes is 16 kb. In both normal DNA and HPFH DNA, the gamma genes are interrupted by an intervening sequence, approximately 1 kb in length that is situated between codon positions 99 and 121 of the coding sequence.

Three types of variant restriction enzyme patterns of globin DNA fragments were detected in otherwise normal individuals. One variant pattern, found in only one person, was caused by an additional restriction endonuclease Pst I cleavage site in the center of the delta- globin gene intervening sequence; the subject was heterozygous for the presence of this cleavage site and was shown to have inherited it from her mother. Another variant pattern resulted from the appearance of an endonuclease Hind III cleavage site in the intervening sequence of the A gamma-globin gene; this variant is polymorphic, with a gene frequency for the presence of the intragenic Hind III site of 0.23. This Hind III cleavage site polymorphism is also found in the G gamma-globin gene intervening sequence and thus the polymorphism itself appears to be duplicated over the pair of gamma-globin loci.

The SUP4 gene was then cloned from an ochre-suppressing yeast strain and analyzed by DNA sequencing. A wild-type SUP4 gene and two other genetically unidentified tRNATyr genes were also sequenced. The sequence of the ochre suppressor differs from that of the wild-type genes by virtue of a G.C leads to T.A transversion in the base pair that codes for the wobble position base of the tRNATyr anticodon. All four genes contain, immediately to the 3' side of the anticodon triplet, a 14 base pair tract that is not present in mature tRNATyr. Although the four genes, which represent three unlinked chromosomal loci, all encode the same mature tRNA sequence, there is virtually no observable sequence homology between the three loci in the region preceding the 5' end of the mature tRNATyr sequences.},

In addition, the complete sequence provides information about the higher order organization of yeast's 16 chromosomes and allows some insight into their evolutionary history. The genome shows a considerable amount of apparent genetic redundancy, and one of the major problems to be tackled during the next stage of the yeast genome project is to elucidate the biological functions of all of these genes.},

abstract = {We report a genome-wide association scan in over 6,000 Latin Americans for features of scalp hair (shape, colour, greying, balding) and facial hair (beard thickness, monobrow, eyebrow thickness). We found 18 signals of association reaching genome-wide significance (P values 5 {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}} 8 to 3 {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}} 119), including 10 novel associations. These include novel loci for scalp hair shape and balding, and the first reported loci for hair greying, monobrow, eyebrow and beard thickness. A newly identified locus influencing hair shape includes a Q30R substitution in the Protease Serine S1 family member 53 (PRSS53). We demonstrate that this enzyme is highly expressed in the hair follicle, especially the inner root sheath, and that the Q30R substitution affects enzyme processing and secretion. The genome regions associated with hair features are enriched for signals of selection, consistent with proposals regarding the evolution of human hair.},

abstract = {Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21{\%}, ∼24{\%} and ∼29{\%} of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60{\%} of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/$\beta$-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.},

abstract = {Waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a measure of body fat distribution and a predictor of metabolic consequences independent of overall adiposity. WHR is heritable, but few genetic variants influencing this trait have been identified. We conducted a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies for WHR adjusted for body mass index (comprising up to 77,167 participants), following up 16 loci in an additional 29 studies (comprising up to 113,636 subjects). We identified 13 new loci in or near RSPO3, VEGFA, TBX15-WARS2, NFE2L3, GRB14, DNM3-PIGC, ITPR2-SSPN, LY86, HOXC13, ADAMTS9, ZNRF3-KREMEN1, NISCH-STAB1 and CPEB4 (P = 1.9 × 10⁻⁹ to P = 1.8 × 10⁻⁴⁰) and the known signal at LYPLAL1. Seven of these loci exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, all with a stronger effect on WHR in women than men (P for sex difference = 1.9 × 10⁻³ to P = 1.2 × 10⁻¹³). These findings provide evidence for multiple loci that modulate body fat distribution independent of overall adiposity and reveal strong gene-by-sex interactions.},

One of these challenges is haplotype inference; methods for haplotype inference designed for small data sets from candidate-gene studies do not scale well to the large number of individuals genotyped in whole-genome association studies. We present a new method and software for inference of haplotype phase and missing data that can accurately phase data from whole-genome association studies, and we present the first comparison of haplotype-inference methods for real and simulated data sets with thousands of genotyped individuals. We find that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy for large data sets with thousands of individuals and densely spaced genetic markers, and we use our method to phase a real data set of 3,002 individuals genotyped for 490,032 markers in 3.1 days of computing time, with 99{\%} of masked alleles imputed correctly. Our method is implemented in the Beagle software package, which is freely available.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify common alleles that contribute to complex disease susceptibility. Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies.},

The DNA to be sequenced is first subjected to limit attach by a non-specific endonuclease (DNase I in the presence of Mn++), fractionated by size and cloned in a single-stranded phage vector. Clones are then picked at random and used to provide a template for sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. This technique was used to sequence completely a 4257 bp EcoRI fragment of bovine mitochondrial DNA. The cloned fragments were evenly distributed with respect to the EcoRI fragment, and completion of the entire sequence required the construction of only a single library. In general, once a clone library has been prepared, the speed of this approach (greater than 1000 nucleotides of randomly selected sequence per day) is limited mainly by the rate at which the data can be processed. Because the clones are selected randomly, however, the average amount of new sequence information per clone is substantially diminished as the sequence near completion.},

abstract = {Association studies offer a potentially powerful approach to identify genetic variants that influence susceptibility to common disease, but are plagued by the impression that they are not consistently reproducible. In principle, the inconsistency may be due to false positive studies, false negative studies or true variability in association among different populations. The critical question is whether false positives overwhelmingly explain the inconsistency. We analyzed 301 published studies covering 25 different reported associations. There was a large excess of studies replicating the first positive reports, inconsistent with the hypothesis of no true positive associations (P {\textless} 10(-14)). This excess of replications could not be reasonably explained by publication bias and was concentrated among 11 of the 25 associations. For 8 of these 11 associations, pooled analysis of follow-up studies yielded statistically significant replication of the first report, with modest estimated genetic effects. Thus, a sizable fraction (but under half) of reported associations have strong evidence of replication; for these, false negative, underpowered studies probably contribute to inconsistent replication. We conclude that there are probably many common variants in the human genome with modest but real effects on common disease risk, and that studies using large samples will convincingly identify such variants.},

abstract = {Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations, if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention, prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.},

Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events.

abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother–father–child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95{\%} of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10 28 per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research. Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is one of the central goals in biology and medicine. The reference human genome sequence 1 provides a foundation for the study of human genetics, but systematic investigation of human variation requires full knowledge of DNA sequence variation across the entire spectrum of allele frequencies and types of DNA differences. Substantial progress has already been made. By 2008 the public catalogue of variant sites (dbSNP 129) contained approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 million short insertions and deletions (indels) 2–4 . Databases of structural variants (for example, dbVAR) indexed the locations of large genomic variants. The International HapMap Project catalogued both allele frequencies and the correlation patterns between nearby variants, a phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium (LD), across several populations for 3.5 million SNPs 3,4},

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r 2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r 2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10–30{\%} of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1{\%} of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

To inform the design and interpretation of such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,184 reference individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3', includes both SNPs and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized population-specific differences among low-frequency variants, measured the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel, especially in imputing SNPs with a minor allele frequency of {\#}5{\%}, and demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly discovered CNPs and SNPs. This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation.},

abstract = {The association between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and an allele of a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 5' to the coding region of the insulin gene has raised the possibility that variation in the vicinity of the insulin gene confers susceptibility to IDDM. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of insulin gene sharing in affected sib pairs (ASPs) from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 5 (GAW5) families has been compared with that expected on the basis of random assortment. There is no deviation from random expectation in insulin gene sharing among 95 ASPs from families fully informative for the insulin gene. This is also true when insulin gene sharing is conditioned on HLA sharing, on the particular HLA DR types in ASPs, or on the parents' insulin allele classes. These results thus provide no evidence that variation at or near the insulin gene confers susceptibility to IDDM. However, we also used computer simulation to investigate how the insulin gene region could contribute susceptibility to IDDM without yielding evidence for distortion in insulin gene sharing in a sample comparable to that of GAW5. We found that various levels of insulin gene involvement in IDDM could generate a population association between the insulin gene RFLP and IDDM comparable to that reported in the literature, without producing significant distortion in insulin gene sharing of ASPs.},

abstract = {A population association has consistently been observed between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the "class 1" alleles of the region of tandem-repeat DNA (5' flanking polymorphism [5'FP]) adjacent to the insulin gene on chromosome 11p. This finding suggests that the insulin gene region contains a gene or genes contributing to IDDM susceptibility. However, several studies that have sought to show linkage with IDDM by testing for cosegregation in affected sib pairs have failed to find evidence for linkage. As means for identifying genes for complex diseases, both the association and the affected-sib-pairs approaches have limitations. It is well known that population association between a disease and a genetic marker can arise as an artifact of population structure, even in the absence of linkage. On the other hand, linkage studies with modest numbers of affected sib pairs may fail to detect linkage, especially if there is linkage heterogeneity. We consider an alternative method to test for linkage with a genetic marker when population association has been found. Using data from families with at least one affected child, we evaluate the transmission of the associated marker allele from a heterozygous parent to an affected offspring. This approach has been used by several investigators, but the statistical properties of the method as a test for linkage have not been investigated. In the present paper we describe the statistical basis for this "transmission test for linkage disequilibrium" (transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]). We then show the relationship of this test to tests of cosegregation that are based on the proportion of haplotypes or genes identical by descent in affected sibs. The TDT provides strong evidence for linkage between the 5'FP and susceptibility to IDDM. The conclusions from this analysis apply in general to the study of disease associations, where genetic markers are usually closely linked to candidate genes. When a disease is found to be associated with such a marker, the TDT may detect linkage even when haplotype-sharing tests do not.},

abstract = {We have developed methods for covalently joining duplex DNA molecules to one another and have used these techniques to construct circular dimers of SV40 DNA and to insert a DNA segment containing lambda phage genes and the galactose operon of E. coli into SV40 DNA. The method involves: (a) converting circular SV40 DNA to a linear form, (b) adding single-stranded homodeoxypolymeric extensions of defined composition and length to the 3' ends of one of the DNA strands with the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (c) adding complementary homodeoxypolymeric extensions to the other DNA strand, (d) annealing the two DNA mole-cules to form a circular duplex structure, and (e) filling the gaps and sealing nicks in this structure with E. coli DNA polymerase and DNA ligase to form a covalently closed-circular DNA molecule. Our goal is to develop a method by which new, functionally defined segments of genetic information can be introduced into mammalian cells. It is known that the DNA of the trans-forming virus SV40 can enter into a stable, heritable, and presumably covalent association with the genomes of various mammalian cells (1, 2). Since purified SV40 DNA can also transform cells (although with reduced efficiency), it seemed possible that SV40 DNA molecules, into which a segment of functionally defined, nonviral DNA had been covalently integrated, could serve as vectors to transport and stabilize},

@article{Sanger1977,
abstract = {A new method for determining nucleotide se-quences in DNA is described. It is similar to the "plus and minus" method [Sanger, F. {\&} Coulson, A. R. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 94,441-4481 but makes use of the 2',3'-dideoxy and arabinonu-cleoside analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which act as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerase. The technique has been applied to the DNA of bacteriophage 4bX174 and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method. The "plus and minus" method (1) is a relatively rapid and simple technique that has made possible the determination of the sequence of the genome of bacteriophage 4X174 (2). It depends on the use of DNA polymerase to transcribe specific regions of the DNA under controlled conditions. Although the method is considerably more rapid and simple than other available techniques, neither the "plus" nor the "minus" method is completely accurate, and in order to establish a se-quence both must be used together, and sometimes confirma-tory data are necessary. W. M. Barnes (J. Mol. Biol., in press) has recently developed a third method, involving ribo-substi-tution, which has certain advantages over the plus and minus method, but this has not yet been extensively exploited. Another rapid and simple method that depends on specific chemical degradation of the DNA has recently been described by Maxam and Gilbert (3), and this has also been used exten-sively for DNA sequencing. It has the advantage over the plus and minus method that it can be applied to double-stranded DNA, but it requires a strand separation or equivalent frac-tionation of each restriction enzyme fragment studied, which makes it somewhat more laborious. This paper describes a further method using DNA poly-merase, which makes use of inhibitors that terminate the newly synthesized chains at specific residues. Principle of the Method. Atkinson et al. (4) showed that the inhibitory activity of 2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) on DNA polymerase I depends on its being incorpo-rated into the growing oligonucleotide chain in the place of thymidylic acid (dT). Because the ddT contains no 3'-hydroxyl group, the chain cannot be extended further, so that termination occurs specifically at positions where dT should be incorporated. If a primer and template are incubated with DNA polymerase in the presence of a mixture of ddTTP and dTTP, as well as the other three deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (one of which is labeled with 32p), a mixture of fragments all having the same 5' and with ddT residues at the 3' ends is obtained. When this mixture is fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing acrylamide gels the pattern of bands shows the distribution of dTs in the newly synthesized DNA. By using analogous ter-minators for the other nucleotides in separate incubations and running the samples in parallel on the gel, a pattern of bands is obtained from which the sequence can be read off as in the other rapid techniques mentioned above. Two types of terminating triphosphates have been used-the dideoxy derivatives and the arabinonucleosides. Arabinose is},

Verwandte Wiss. 1 (1816) 185-196] used invariance under parameter transformation when deriving his estimate of the standard deviation in the normal case. Hagen [Grundzuge der Wahrschein-lichkeits-Rechnung, Dummler, Berlin (1837)] used the maximum likelihood argument for deriving the frequentist version of the method of least squares for the linear normal model. Edgeworth [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. 72 (1909) 81-90] proved the asymptotic normality and optimality of the maximum likelihood estimate for a restricted class of distributions. Fisher had two aversions: noninvariance and unbiasedness. Replacing the posterior mode by the maximum likelihood estimate he achieved invariance, and using a two-stage method of maximum likelihood he avoided appealing to unbiasedness for the linear normal model.},

abstract = {1. Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters. He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of acquired characters had been accepted previously by Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and Erasmus Darwin among others. 2. If we wish to trace the history of evolution, we should search for naturalists who lived before Lamarck and who did not believe in the inheritance of acquired characters. Brock listed but two, (1) the unknown editor of Aristotle's "Historia Animalium," and (2) the philosopher, Immanuel Kant. 3. The dogma of the immutability of species met with general acceptance only late in the eighteenth and early in the nineteenth century. Botanists from the time of Theophrastos to the time of Linnaeus believed in "degeneration." "Degeneration" did not then have its modern meaning, but was synonymous with De Vriesian mutation. Belief in degeneration was not incompatible with belief in special creation, as its effects were supposed to be neither orderly nor cumulative. 4. In order to understand what Charles Darwin meant by his provisional hypothesis of pangenesis, it is necessary that we do not give to the terms he used the meanings which they acquired during the twentieth century. Darwin's conception of the germ-plasm was not the one currently accepted. He considered the theory that the foetus was produced from an egg fertilized by a single spermatozoan but rejected it. He believed that the whole semen was a fertilizing substance and that the foetus resembled the father in proportion to the amount of semen ejaculated in coition. Furthermore, he believed in telegony and in the specific influence of semen upon the mother's body. 5. The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by Hippocrates, Democritus, Galen (?), Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius, St. Isidore of Seville, Bartholomeus Anglicus, St. Albert the Great, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Peter of Crescentius (?), Paracelsus, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, Venette, John Ray, Buffon, Bonnet, Maupertius, von Haller and Herbert Spencer. A careful search of our available records should add a number of names to this list.},

abstract = {Linear mixed models have attracted considerable attention recently as a powerful and effective tool for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genetic association tests. However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To address this issue, several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), that makes approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This method is approximately n times faster than the widely used exact method known as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals. There is an increasing interest in using linear mixed models (LMMs, also known as mixed linear models (MLMs)) to test for association in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because of their dem-onstrated effectiveness in accounting for relatedness among samples and in controlling for population stratification and other confounding factors 1–7 . However, these models present substantial computational challenges. For example, at the time that this work was submitted for publication, the most efficient algorithm for effectively com-puting exact association test statistics (either the Wald test or the likelihood-ratio test) implemented in the EMMA software 3 had a per-SNP computation time that increased with the cube of the number of individuals (n). As a result, an average-sized GWAS including a few thousand individuals and half a million SNPs would take years of central processing unit (CPU) time to analyze 1,7 . While this paper was in review, Lippert et al. 8 also published an efficient algorithm for this model, implemented in the FaST-LMM software; the relationship between this algorithm and ours is discussed. Several approximation methods have been proposed to make genome-wide analysis using linear mixed models possible. Probably the simplest and fastest of these approximations, genome-wide rapid association using mixed model and regression (GRAMMAR) imple-mented in the GenABEL software 9 first estimates the residuals from the LMM under the null model (no SNP effect) and then treats these residuals as phenotypes for further genome-wide analysis by a standard linear model 10 . This substantially reduces per-SNP computation time, making it linear with respect to the number of individuals included. More recently, two more sophisticated approximate approaches have been suggested. Zhang et al. 7 use population parameters previously determined (P3D), which avoids repeatedly estimating variance com-ponents when performing each test by simply using the pre-estimated variance components from the null model; their method is imple-mented in the TASSEL software. Kang et al. 1 also avoid repeatedly estimating variance components by a slightly different strategy, which keeps the heritability estimated from the null model fixed when test-ing individual SNPs. Their approach is implemented in the EMMA eXpedited (EMMAX) software. (This approximation and related ideas were also considered by previous authors 10,11 .) Both approximations have per-SNP computation time that increases quadratically with the number of individuals, which makes them practical on a single desktop computer for GWAS involving thousands of individuals. Although in some settings the approximate methods provide results almost identical to those from the exact method 1,7 , this is not gua-ranteed in general, and in practice it is hard to know how accurate the approximations will be without running an exact calculation. One pos-sible consequence of inaccuracy in the approximation could be a reduc-tion in power relative to exact methods. For these reasons, the ability to perform exact calculations remains of interest. Here, we present a new, more efficient method for exact calculations that provides numerically identical results to EMMA (exact Wald or likelihood-ratio test statistics) but is roughly n times faster (computation time per SNP, when using the usual genome-wide relatedness matrix, increases quadratically with the number of individuals, with a run time similar to that of EMMAX). This makes exact calculations feasible for large GWAS, thereby obviating the need for approximate methods in most common settings.},

abstract = {To identify large proteins with an EGF-like-motif in a systematic manner, we developed a computer-assisted method called motif-trap screening. The method exploits 5'-end single-pass sequence data obtained from a pool of cDNAs whose sizes exceed 5 kb. Using this screening procedure, we were able to identify five known and nine new genes for proteins with multiple EGF-like-motifs from 8000 redundant human brain cDNA clones. These new genes were found to encode a novel mammalian homologue of Drosophila fat protein, two seven-transmembrane proteins containing multiple cadherin and EGF-like motifs, two mammalian homologues of Drosophila slit protein, an unidentified LDL receptor-like protein, and three totally uncharacterized proteins. The organization of the domains in the proteins, together with their expression profiles and fine chromosomal locations, has indicated their biological significance, demonstrating that motif-trap screening is a powerful tool for the discovery of new genes that have been difficult to identify by conventional methods.},

abstract = {The search for genes of complex traits is aided by the availability of multiple quantitative phenotypes collected in geographically isolated populations. Here we provide rationale for a large-scale study of gene-environment interactions influencing brain and behavior and cardiovascular and metabolic health in adolescence, namely the Saguenay Youth Study (SYS). The SYS is a retrospective study of long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking (PEMCS) in which multiple quantitative phenotypes are acquired over five sessions (telephone interview, home, hospital, laboratory, and school). To facilitate the search for genes that modify an individual's response to an in utero environment (i.e. PEMCS), the study is family-based (adolescent sibships) and is carried out in a relatively geographically isolated population of the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) region in Quebec, Canada. DNA is acquired in both biological parents and in adolescent siblings. A genome-wide scan will be carried out with sib-pair linkage analyses, and fine mapping of identified loci will be done with family-based association analyses. Adolescent sibships (12-18 years of age; two or more siblings per family) are recruited in high schools throughout the SLSJ region; only children of French-Canadian origin are included. Based on a telephone interview, potential participants are classified as exposed or nonexposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking; the two groups are matched for the level of maternal education and the attended school. A total of 500 adolescent participants in each group will be recruited and phenotyped. The following types of datasets are collected in all adolescent participants: (1) magnetic resonance images of brain, abdominal fat, and kidneys, (2) standardized and computer-based neuropsychological tests, (3) hospital-based cardiovascular, body-composition and metabolic assessments, and (4) questionnaire-derived measures (e.g. life habits such as eating and physical activity; drug, alcohol use and delinquency; psychiatric symptoms; personality; home and school environment; academic and vocational attitudes). Parents complete a medical questionnaire, home-environment questionnaire, a handedness questionnaire, and a questionnaire about their current alcohol and drug use, depression, anxiety, and current and past antisocial behavior. To date, we have fully phenotyped a total of 408 adolescent participants. Here we provide the description of the SYS and, using the initial sample, we present information on ascertainment, demographics of the exposed and nonexposed adolescents and their parents, and the initial MRI-based assessment of familiality in the brain size and the volumes of grey and white matter.},

The 13 genetic loci previously associ-ated with atrial fibrillation in Europeans were again observed, while 1 locus previously reported in Asians only did not reach genome-wide significance in our study (CUX2). In a meta-analysis of ExWAS in 17 studies, we identified two additional new genetic loci (SCN10A and SOX5; P {\textless} 1.04 × 10 −6) as well as one new locus also identified in the GWAS meta-analysis (SLC35F1–PLN) (Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Variants at each of these three loci have previously been associated with elec-trocardiographic traits (Supplementary Table 3). Finally, in an RVAS or burden test of rare variants, one gene, SH3PXD2A, reached genome-wide significance. This association was mainly driven by a rare coding variant that is unique to individuals of Asian ancestry (rs202011870, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.18{\%}, odds ratio (OR) = 4.68, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 2.97–7.39, P = 3.3 × 10 −11 ; Supplementary Tables 3–5), and the same locus was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation in the GWAS meta-analysis. Of the 11 variants in the Asian-ancestry burden test, rs149867987 also reached genome-wide significance and had an effect in the same direction as rs202011870. There was no genome-wide significant signal at SH3PXD2A in RVAS analyses in individuals of European-or African-American ancestry. Ancestry-specific GWAS analysis identified a significant associa-tion for African Americans (641 cases and 5,234 referents) between atrial fibrillation and variants on chromosome 4q25 upstream of PITX2 (rs6843082, OR = 1.40, 95{\%} CI = 1.24–1.58, P = 4.31 × 10 −8 ; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6). Similarly, the 4q25/PITX2 region was the most significant locus for atrial fibrillation in individuals of Japanese ancestry (rs2723334, OR = 1.94, 95{\%} CI = 1.68–2.25, P = 8.46 × 10 −19) and European ancestry (rs2129977, OR = 1.45, 95{\%} CI = 1.41–1.49, P = 7.25 × 10 −136), and the lead SNPs in all three ancestry groups are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), with r 2 {\textgreater} 0.94. Further ancestry-specific meta-analyses did not produce additional robust associations for atrial fibrillation (Supplementary Figs. 4–6, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7, and Supplementary Note). Separate meta-analyses of incident and prevalent atrial fibrillation in Europeans identified one additional genome-wide signal at chromo-some 12p11/PKP2 that was only present in the prevalent atrial fibrilla-tion analysis (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8, Supplementary Tables 8 and 9, and Supplementary Note); however, because this locus was not present in the combined analyses it was not pursued further.

abstract = {Aims Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare con-genital cardiomyopathy with a high morbidity and mor-tality due to malignant arrhythmias and pump failure. Areas affected by non-compaction are characterized by increased trabecularization and deep inter-trabecular spaces. We hypothesized perfusion defects in these areas and performed positron emission tomography to evaluate the myocardial perfusion in non-compacted areas. Methods and Results Five children (age 10–14 years) with isolated ventricular non-compaction underwent posi-tron emission tomography using N-13-ammonia as flow marker and intravenous dipyridamole for stress testing. Myocardial blood flow was quantified using the positron emission tomography time–activity curves in non-compacted areas and normal myocardium, which were diagnosed by echocardiography, magnetic resonance imag-ing, and angiography. Coronary angiography, performed in two children with extensive forms of left ventricular non-compaction, demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Myocardial blood flow measurements at rest and after dipyridamole application demonstrated 16–33{\%} and 32– 57{\%} perfusion impairment, respectively, in non-compacted areas compared to normal myocardium. Areas of restricted myocardial perfusion corresponded well to the non-compacted areas, defined echographically and by magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion Positron emission tomography demonstrates restricted myocardial perfusion and decreased flow reserve in areas of ventricular non-compaction in children. The myocardial perfusion defects in non-compacted areas may be the cause of myocardial damage and possibly form the basis of arrhythmias and pump failure. (Eur Heart J 1999; 20: 910–916)},

BACKGROUND In IVNC, which is a cardiomyopathy thus far " unclassified " by the World Health Organization, heart failure and sudden cardiac death are common findings, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown. METHODS In 12 patients with IVNC and 14 control subjects, quantitative evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion (myocardial blood flow [MBF]) and coronary flow reserve (CFR, hyperemic/baseline MBF) was performed using positron emission tomography and 13 N-ammonia. The left ventricular myocardium was divided into nine segments, and the two-dimensional echocardiogram in each patient with IVNC was compared with CFR in each segment. Noncompaction was defined as a two-layered structure with excessive trabeculation. RESULTS The CFR in control subjects averaged 4.2 Ϯ 0.9, providing a cut-off value Ն2.5, but it was 2.1 Ϯ 0.8 in patients with IVNC. A perfusion scan defect was found in 14 of 24 segments with noncompaction, although no defect was found in 76 of 84 normal segments (overall agreement 83{\%}, p Ͻ 0.0001 by the chi-square test). In 16 of 21 segments with noncompac-tion, a decreased CFR was found; but a decreased CFR was also found in 36 of 60 segments without noncompaction (p ϭ NS). In 45 of the 57 segments with wall motion abnormalities, CFR was decreased, but it was preserved in 17 of the 24 segments with normal wall motion (agreement 77{\%}, p Ͻ 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with IVNC, a decreased CFR is not confined to noncompacted segments, but extends to most segments with wall motion abnormalities. Thus, coronary microcirculatory dysfunction is associated with IVNC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We sought to describe characteristics and outcome in adults with isolated ventricular noncompaction (IVNC). BACKGROUND Isolated ventricular noncompaction is an unclassified cardiomyopathy due to intrauterine arrest of compaction of the loose interwoven meshwork. Knowledge regarding diagnosis, morbidity and prognosis is limited. METHODS Echocardiographic criteria for IVNC include-in the absence of significant heart lesions-segmental thickening of the left ventricular myocardial wall consisting of two layers: a thin, compacted epicardial and an extremely thickened endocardial layer with prominent trabeculations and deep recesses. Thirty-four adults (age {\textgreater}16 years, 25 men) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria and were followed prospectively. RESULTS At diagnosis, mean age was 42 + 17 years, and 12 patients (35{\%}) were in New York Heart Association class III/IV. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 65 + 12 mm and ejection fraction 33 + 13{\%}. Apex and/or midventricular segments of both the inferior and lateral wall were involved in {\textgreater}80{\%} of patients. Follow-up was 44 + 40 months. Major complications were heart failure in 18 patients (53{\%}), thromboembolic events in 8 patients (24{\%}) and ventricular tachycardias in 14 patients (41{\%}). There were 12 deaths: sudden in six, end-stage heart failure in four and other causes in two patients. Four patients underwent heart transplantation. Automated cardioverter/defibrillators were implanted in four patients. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of IVNC by echocardiography using strict criteria is feasible. Its mortality and morbidity are high, including heart failure, thrombo-embolic events and ventricular arrhythmias. Risk stratification includes heart failure therapy, oral anticoagulation, heart transplantation and implantation of an automated defibrillator/cardioverter. As IVNC is a distinct entity, its classification as a specific cardiomyopathy seems to be more appropriate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the entity of isolated ventricular noncompaction (IVNC) and present a series of cases of this rare disorder in an adult population. MATERIAL AND METHODS We review a 10-year experience with the diagnosis of IVNC and discuss the clinical, echocardiographic, and pathologic features of this condition. Echocardiographic diagnostic criteria included the absence of coexisting cardiac abnormalities, the presence of prominent and excessive trabeculations of one or more ventricular wall segments, and intertrabecular spaces perfused from the ventricular cavity. Pathologic examination focused on regions with exaggerated trabeculations and deep intertrabecular spaces. RESULTS IVNC is an unexplained arrest of myocardial morphogenesis previously encountered mainly in pediatric patients. Among 37,555 transthoracic echocardiographic studies performed at our hospital between January 1984 and October 1993, 17 cases of IVNC were identified in adult subjects (14 men and 3 women, 18 to 71 years of age). The mean time from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was 3.5 +/- 5.7 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 30 +/- 28 months. Common clinical symptoms were heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and a history of embolic events. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed 10 patients with left ventricular and 7 (41{\%}) with biventricular IVNC. During a 6-year follow-up period, eight patients died and two underwent heart transplantation. CONCLUSION Although the diagnosis of IVNC in an adult population is often delayed because of similarities with more frequently diagnosed conditions, two-dimensional echocardiography will facilitate the diagnosis of IVNC in this subset of patients. Because of the high incidence of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and embolization in adults with IVNC, early diagnosis is important.},

While cardiac ischemia due to microvascular dysfunction is common in these patients, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is rare and usually seen as a consequence of coincidental coronary artery disease. We report the case of a 20 year-old male patient admitted to our emergency department with a complaint of squeezing chest pain who was subsequently diagnosed with STEMI according to electrocardiographic findings, although an emergent coronary angiogram demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Echocardiography revealed isolated LVNC, and the diagnosis was confirmed via magnetic resonance imaging. Repeat coronary catheterization with acetylcholine infusion and coronary flow reserve measurement failed to demonstrate vasospasm or microvascular dysfunction. As no apparent cause was found, this case was designated 'idiopathic' myocardial infarction. Coronary thromboembolism due to stagnation of blood in the left ventricular cavity remained as the most probable mechanism underlying myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Deletion 1p36 syndrome is recognized as the most common terminal deletion syndrome. Here, we describe the loss of a gene within the deletion that is responsible for the cardiomyopathy associated with monosomy 1p36, and we confirm its role in nonsyndromic left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). With our own data and publically available data from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we identified a minimal deletion for the cardiomyopathy associated with 1p36del syndrome that included only the terminal 14 exons of the transcription factor PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16), a gene that had previously been shown to direct brown fat determination and differentiation. Resequencing of PRDM16 in a cohort of 75 nonsyndromic individuals with LVNC detected three mutations, including one truncation mutant, one frameshift null mutation, and a single missense mutant. In addition, in a series of cardiac biopsies from 131 individuals with DCM, we found 5 individuals with 4 previously unreported nonsynonymous variants in the coding region of PRDM16. None of the PRDM16 mutations identified were observed in more than 6,400 controls. PRDM16 has not previously been associated with cardiac disease but is localized in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes throughout murine and human development and in the adult heart. Modeling of PRDM16 haploinsufficiency and a human truncation mutant in zebrafish resulted in both contractile dysfunction and partial uncoupling of cardiomyocytes and also revealed evidence of impaired cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity. In conclusion, mutation of PRDM16 causes the cardiomyopathy in 1p36 deletion syndrome as well as a proportion of nonsyndromic LVNC and DCM.},

@article{Zeglinski2016,
abstract = {Inappropriate cardiac interstitial remodeling is mediated by activated phenoconverted myofibroblasts. The synthesis of matrix proteins by these cells is triggered by both chemical and mechanical stimuli. Ski is a repressor of TGF$\beta$1/Smad signaling and has been described as possessing anti-fibrotic properties within the myocardium. We hypothesized that overexpression of Ski in myofibroblasts will induce an apoptotic response, which may either be supported or opposed by autophagic flux. We used primary myofibroblasts (activated fibroblasts) which were sourced from whole heart preparations that were only passaged once. We found that overexpression of Ski results in distinct morphological and biochemical changes within primary cardiac myofibroblasts associated with apoptosis. Ski treatment was associated with the expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, caspase-7, and -9. Our results indicate that Ski triggers a pro-death mechanism in primary rat cardiac myofibroblasts that is mediated through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Myofibroblast survival is prolonged by an autophagic response, as the dataset indicate that apoptosis is hastened when autophagy is inhibited. We suggest that the apoptotic death response of myofibroblasts is working in parallel with the previously observed anti-fibrotic properties of Ski within this cell type. As myofibroblasts are the sole mediators of matrix expansion in heart failure, we suggest that Ski, or a putative Ski-mimetic, may induce graded apoptosis in myofibroblasts within the failing heart and may be a novel therapeutic approach towards controlling cardiac fibrosis. Future studies are needed to examine the potential effects of Ski overexpression on other cell types in the heart.},

abstract = {CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by: craniosynostosis of the coronal, sagittal, or lambdoid sutures; dolichocephaly; distinctive craniofacial features; skeletal changes (dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, pes planus, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis, joint hypermobility or contractures and C1/C2 spine malformation); neurologic abnormalities; intellectual disability; and brain anomalies (hydrocephalus, dilatation of the lateral ventricles, and Chiari 1 malformation). Cardiovascular anomalies may include mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation/incompetence, aortic regurgitation, and aortic root dilatation. Minimal subcutaneous fat, abdominal wall defects, myopia, and cryptorchidism in males are also characteristic findings. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING The diagnosis of SGS is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical findings and radiographic findings showing C1-C2 abnormality, wide anterior fontanel, thin ribs, square-shaped vertebral bodies, and osteopenia. SKI is the only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. MANAGEMENT Treatment of manifestations: If aortic dilatation is present, treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers or other medications should be considered in order to reduce hemodynamic stress; surgical intervention for aneurysms may be indicated. Surgical repair of abdominal hernias; standard management of cleft palate and craniosynostosis; surgical fixation of cervical spine instability; routine management for clubfoot deformity; surgical correction for pectus excavatum (rarely indicated); physiotherapy for joint contractures; developmental assessment with placement in special education programs. Prevention of secondary complications: Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis is recommended for dental work or other procedures for individuals with cardiac complications. Surveillance: Management by a cardiologist familiar with this condition is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports; use of agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system; activities that may lead to joint pain and/or injury. GENETIC COUNSELING Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS), resulting from a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SKI, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with SGS have unaffected parents suggesting that the causative variant has occurred either as a de novo event in the affected individual or as a result of germline mosaicism in one of the parents. Affected sibs born to unaffected parents support the occurrence of germline mosaicism in some families with SGS.},

@article{Botstein1980,
abstract = {We describe a new basis for the construction of a genetic linkage map of the human genome. The basic principle of the mapping scheme is to develop, by recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA probes capable of detecting DNA sequence polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

I once before ventured to draw attention to this law on far more slender evidence than I now possess. It is some years since I made an extensive series of experiments on the produce of seeds of different size but of the same species.

@article{Cupples2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The Framingham Heart Study (FHS), founded in 1948 to examine the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, is among the most comprehensively characterized multi-generational studies in the world. Many collected phenotypes have substantial genetic contributors; yet most genetic determinants remain to be identified. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a 100K genome-wide scan, we examine the associations of common polymorphisms with phenotypic variation in this community-based cohort and provide a full-disclosure, web-based resource of results for future replication studies. METHODS Adult participants (n = 1345) of the largest 310 pedigrees in the FHS, many biologically related, were genotyped with the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. These genotypes were used to assess their contribution to 987 phenotypes collected in FHS over 56 years of follow up, including: cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers; subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease; cancer and longevity traits; and traits in pulmonary, sleep, neurology, renal, and bone domains. We conducted genome-wide variance components linkage and population-based and family-based association tests. RESULTS The participants were white of European descent and from the FHS Original and Offspring Cohorts (examination 1 Offspring mean age 32 +/- 9 years, 54{\%} women). This overview summarizes the methods, selected findings and limitations of the results presented in the accompanying series of 17 manuscripts. The presented association results are based on 70,897 autosomal SNPs meeting the following criteria: minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or + 10{\%}, genotype call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001, and satisfying Mendelian consistency. Linkage analyses are based on 11,200 SNPs and short-tandem repeats. Results of phenotype-genotype linkages and associations for all autosomal SNPs are posted on the NCBI dbGaP website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. CONCLUSION We have created a full-disclosure resource of results, posted on the dbGaP website, from a genome-wide association study in the FHS. Because we used three analytical approaches to examine the association and linkage of 987 phenotypes with thousands of SNPs, our results must be considered hypothesis-generating and need to be replicated. Results from the FHS 100K project with NCBI web posting provides a resource for investigators to identify high priority findings for replication.},

abstract = {The study of families with rare inherited forms of hypo-and hyper-tension has been one of the most successful strategies to probe the molecular pathophysiology of blood pressure control and has revealed dysregulation of distal nephron Na + reabsorption to be a common mechanism. FHHt (familial hyperkalaemic hypertension; also known as Gordon's syndrome) is a salt-dependent form of hypertension caused by mutations in the regulators of the thiazide-sensitive Na + –Cl − co-transporter NCC [also known as SLC12A3 (solute carrier family 12 member 3)] and is effectively treated by thiazide diuretics and/or dietary salt restriction. Variation in at least four genes can cause FHHt, including WNK1 [With No lysine (=K) 1] and WNK4, KLHL3 (kelch-like family member 3), and CUL3 (cullin 3). In the present study we have identified novel disease-causing variants in CUL3 and KLHL3 segregating in 63 {\%} of the pedigrees with previously unexplained FHHt, confirming the importance of these recently described FHHt genes. We have demonstrated conclusively, in two unrelated affected individuals, that rare intronic variants in CUL3 cause the skipping of exon 9 as has been proposed previously. KLHL3 variants all occur in kelch-repeat domains and so probably disrupt WNK complex binding. We have found no evidence of any plausible disease-causing variants within SLC4A8 (an alternative thiazide-sensitive sodium transporter) in this population. The results of the present study support the existing evidence that the CUL3 and KLHL3 gene products are physiologically important regulators of thiazide-sensitive distal nephron NaCl reabsorption, and hence potentially interesting novel anti-hypertensive drug targets. As a third of our non-WNK FHHt families do not have plausible CUL3 or KLHL3 variants, there are probably additional, as yet undiscovered, regulators of the thiazide-sensitive pathways.},

These findings implicated components of the troponin complex as candidate genes at other FHC loci, particularly cardiac troponin T, which was mapped in this study to chromosome 1q. Missense mutations (Ile79Asn; Arg92Gln) and a mutation in the splice donor sequence of intron 15 of the cardiac troponin T gene are also shown to cause FHC. Because alpha-tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T as well as beta myosin heavy chain mutations cause the same phenotype, we conclude that FHC is a disease of the sarcomere. Further, because the splice site mutation is predicted to function as a null allele, we suggest that abnormal stoichiometry of sarcomeric proteins can cause cardiac hypertrophy.},

abstract = {A point mutation in exon 13 of the 3 cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene is present in all individuals affected with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) from a large kindred. This missense mutation converts a highly conserved arginine residue (Arg-403) to a glutamine. Affected individuals from an un-related family lack this missense mutation, but instead have an a/j3 cardiac MHC hybrid gene. Identification of two unique mutations within cardiac MHC genes in all individuals with FHC from two unrelated families demonstrates that defects in the cardiac MHC genes can cause this disease. The pathology resulting from a missense mutation at residue 403 further suggests that a critical function of myosin is disrupted by this mutation. Identification of the genetic defect responsible for a dis-ease such as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) has proven to be a difficult task. There are approximately 1200 human diseases that, like FHC, are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The molecular basis of less than 60 of these has been established (McKusick, 1966). One approach to elucidating the molecular etiology of an autosomal dominant disease has been to identify a candi-date gene, often suggested by linkage analyses, and then to demonstrate that the protein encoded by this gene has an altered function in affected individuals. Application of this approach to FHC is difficult because the affected tis-sue (cardiac muscle) is not readily available for analysis and because specific biochemical assays for many func-tions of the candidate protein (myosin heavy chain) do not exist.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review the diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias in a two-part presentation. DATA SOURCES Articles and published peer-review abstracts on tachycardias and bradycardias. SUMMARY OF REVIEW Normal cardiac rhythm originates from impulses generated within the sinus node. These impulses are conducted to the atrioventricular node where they are delayed before they are distributed to the ventricular myocardium via the His-Purkinje system. Abnormalities in cardiac rhythm are caused by disorders of impulse generation, conduction or a combination of the two and may be life threatening due to a reduction in cardiac output or myocardial oxygenation. Cardiac arrhythmias are commonly classified as tachycardias (supraventricular or ventricular) or bradycardias. The differentiation between supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias usually requires an assessment of atrial and ventricular rhythms and their relationship to each other. In the critically ill patient the commonest tachycardia is sinus tachycardia and treatment generally consist of management of the underlying disorder. Other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) include, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) all of which may require cardioversion, although to maintain sinus rhythm, antiarrhythmic therapy is often needed. Adenosine is useful in management and treatment many SVTs although its use in PSVT with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is hazardous. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a characteristic supraventricular tachycardia found in the critical ill patient. While it usually responds to intravenous magnesium sulphate, its management also requires removal of various precipitating factors. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) require urgent cardioversion and defibrillation respectively. Torsade de pointes should be differentiated from these ventricular arrhythmias as antiarrhythmic therapy may be contraindicated. CONCLUSIONS Supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias in the critically ill patient often have underlying disorders that precipitate their development (e.g. hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, anti-arrhythmic proarrhythmia, myocardial ischaemia, etc). While antiarrhythmic therapy and cardioversion or defibrillation may be required to achieve sinus rhythm, correction of the associated abnormalities is also required.},

abstract = {All the myocytes within the heart have the capacity to conduct the cardiac impulse. A population of myocytes is specialized so as to generate the cardiac impulse and then to conduct it from the atrial to the ventricular chambers. This population has become known as the conduction system. Anatomists who seek to demonstrate the location of the components of this system must con-tend with the fact that the components of the system cannot be distinguished from the working myocardial elements by gross dissection. In important pre-sentations to the German Pathological Society in 1910, rules were suggested for the histological distinction of these conducting cells. These rules proposed that the myocytes, to be considered as part of the conduction system, should be histologically discrete, traceable from section to section in serially prepared material, and if to be considered as tracts, should be insulated by fibrous tis-sue from the adjacent myocytes. Immunohistochemical techniques have now been developed that better demonstrate the distinction between the cells spe-cialized to conduct from working myocytes. These new techniques, for the most part, confirm the accuracy of the initial descriptions. They also reveal additional areas with the characteristics of conduction tissues. These additional areas are located in a paranodal area adjacent to the sinus node, in the vesti-bules of both atrioventricular valvular orifices, and in a partial ring around the aortic root. In this review, we describe all these features, emphasizing the relationship of the newly recognized components to the established parts of the cardiac conduction system, and how the new findings need to be assessed in the light of the old criterions.

abstract = {The ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin-type 1 motifs) protein superfamily includes 19 secreted metalloproteases and 7 secreted ADAMTS-like (ADAMTSL) glycoproteins. The possibility of functional linkage between ADAMTS proteins and fibrillin microfibrils was first revealed by a human genetic consilience, in which mutations in ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17, ADAMTSL2 and ADAMTSL4 were found to phenocopy rare genetic disorders caused by mutations affecting fibrillin-1 (FBN1), the major microfibril component in adults. The manifestations of these ADAMTS gene disorders in humans and animals suggested that they participated in the structural and regulatory roles of microfibrils. Whereas two such disorders, Weill-Marchesani syndrome 1 and Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome involve proteases (ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17, respectively), geleophysic dysplasia and isolated ectopia lentis in humans involve ADAMTSL2 and ADAMTSL4, respectively, which are not proteases. In addition to broadly similar dysmorphology, individuals affected by Weill-Marchesani syndrome 1, Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome or geleophysic dysplasia each show characteristic anomalies suggesting molecule-, tissue-, or context-specific functions for the respective ADAMTS proteins. Ectopia lentis occurs in each of these conditions except geleophysic dysplasia, and is due to a defect in the ciliary zonule, which is predominantly composed of FBN1 microfibrils. Together, this strongly suggests that ADAMTS proteins are involved either in microfibril assembly, stability, and anchorage, or the formation of function-specific supramolecular networks having microfibrils as their foundation. Here, the genetics and molecular biology of this subset of ADAMTS proteins is discussed from the perspective of how they might contribute to fully functional or function-specific microfibrils.},

abstract = {Ectopia lentis is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is characterized by the subluxation of the lens resulting from the disruption of the zonular fibers. Patients with ectopia lentis commonly present with a marked loss in visual acuity in addition to a number of possibly accompanying ocular complications including cataract, myopia, and retinal detachment. We here describe an isolated form of ectopia lentis in a large inbred family that shows autosomal-recessive inheritance. We map the ectopia lentis locus in this family to the pericentromeric region on chromosome 1 (1p13.2-q21.1). The linkage region contains well more than 60 genes. Mutation screening of four candidate genes revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 11 of ADAMTSL4 (p.Y595X; c.1785T--{\textgreater}G) in all affected individuals that is absent in 380 control chromosomes. The mutation would result in a truncated protein of half the original length, if the mRNA escapes nonsense-mediated decay. We conclude that mutations in ADAMTSL4 are responsible for autosomal-recessive simple ectopia lentis and that ADAMTS-like4 plays a role in the development and/or integrity of the zonular fibers.},

abstract = {Protein C-mannosylation is the attachment of alpha-mannopyranose to tryptophan via a C-C linkage. This post-translational modification typically occurs within the sequence motif WXXW, which is frequently present in thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs). TSRs are especially numerous in and a defining feature of the ADAMTS superfamily. We investigated the presence and functional significance of C-mannosylation of ADAMTS-like 1/punctin-1, which contains four TSRs (two with predicted C-mannosylation sites), using mass spectrometry, metabolic labeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and expression in C-mannosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell variants. Analysis of tryptic fragments of recombinant human punctin-1 by mass spectrometry identified a peptide derived from TSR1 containing the (36)WDAWGPWSECSRTC(49) sequence of interest modified with two mannose residues and a Glc-Fuc disaccharide (O-fucosylation). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and MS/MS/MS analysis demonstrated the characteristic cross-ring cleavage of C-mannose and identified the modified residues as Trp(39) and Trp(42). C-Mannosylation of TSR1 of the related protease ADAMTS5 was also identified. Metabolic labeling of CHO-K1 cells or Lec35.1 cells demonstrated incorporation of d-[2,6-(3)H]mannose in secreted punctin-1 from CHO-K1 cells but not Lec35.1 cells. Quantitation of punctin-1 secretion in Lec35.1 cells versus CHO-K1 cells suggested decreased secretion in Lec35.1 cells. Replacement of mannosylated Trp residues in TSR1 with either Ala or Phe affected punctin secretion efficiency. These data demonstrate that TSR1 from punctin-1 carries C-mannosylation in close proximity to O-linked fucose. Together, these modifications appear to provide a quality control mechanism for punctin-1 secretion.},

abstract = {Punctin (ADAMTSL-1) is a secreted molecule resembling members of the ADAMTS family of proteases. Punctin lacks the pro-metalloprotease and the disintegrin-like domain typical of this family but contains other ADAMTS domains in precise order including four thrombospondin type I repeats. Punctin is the product of a distinct gene on human chromosome 9p21-22 and mouse chromosome 4 that is expressed in adult skeletal muscle. His-tagged punctin expressed in stably transfected High-Five(TM) insect cells was purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni-chromatography of conditioned medium. The NH(2) terminus is not blocked and has the sequence EEDRD and so forth as determined by Edman degradation, demonstrating signal peptidase processing. Recombinant epitope-tagged punctin has a calculated mass of 59,991 Da but exhibits major molecular species of 61970 +/- 6 Da and 62131 +/- 5 Da as measured by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry. Punctin is a glycoprotein based on carbohydrate staining and liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry glycopeptide analysis. Glycosylation occurs at a single N-linked site as demonstrated by altered electrophoretic migration of punctin expressed in the presence of tunicamycin A. Punctin contains disulfide bonds based on antibody accessibility and electrophoretic migration under reducing versus nonreducing conditions. Rotary shadowing demonstrates that punctin is hatchet-shaped having a globular region attached to a short stem. In transfected COS-1 cells, punctin is deposited in the cell substratum in a punctate fashion and is excluded from focal contacts. Punctin is the first member of a novel family of ADAMTS-like proteins that may have important functions in the extracellular matrix.},

We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene-environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed hundreds of loci associated with common human genetic diseases and traits. We have developed a web-based plotting tool that provides fast visual display of GWAS results in a publication-ready format. LocusZoom visually displays regional information such as the strength and extent of the association signal relative to genomic position, local linkage disequilibrium (LD) and recombination patterns and the positions of genes in the region. AVAILABILITY LocusZoom can be accessed from a web interface at http://csg.sph.umich.edu/locuszoom. Users may generate a single plot using a web form, or many plots using batch mode. The software utilizes LD information from HapMap Phase II (CEU, YRI and JPT+CHB) or 1000 Genomes (CEU) and gene information from the UCSC browser, and will accept SNP identifiers in dbSNP or 1000 Genomes format. Single plots are generated in approximately 20 s. Source code and associated databases are available for download and local installation, and full documentation is available online.},

Having laid down the grounds of the basics in terminology and mathematical formalism, the authors systematically introduce the concept and methods of monofractal time series analysis. They argue that fractal time series analysis cannot be done in a conscious, reliable manner without having a model capable of capturing the essential features of physiological signals with regard to their fractal analysis. They advocate the use of a simple, yet adequate, dichotomous model of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm). They demonstrate the importance of incorporating a step of signal classification according to the fGn/fBm model prior to fractal analysis by showing that missing out on signal class can result in completely meaningless fractal estimates. Limitation and precision of various fractal tools are thoroughly described and discussed using results of numerical experiments on ideal monofractal signals. Steps of a reliable fractal analysis are explained. Finally, the main applications of fractal time series analysis in biomedical research are reviewed and critically evaluated.},

We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated na{\"{i}}ve and effector memory CD4(+) T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.},

abstract = {Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects: geometrically by n points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in some sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects. In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are mono-tonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that confi{\~{}}xlration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a compamon paper. The problem of multidimensional scaling, broadly stated, is to find n points whose interpoint distances match in some sense the experimental dissimilarities of n objects. Instead of dissimilarities the experimental measure-ments may be similarities, confusion probabilities, interaction rates between groups, correlation coefficients, or other measures of proximity or dissociation of the most diverse kind. Whether a large value implies closeness or its opposite is a detail and has no essential significance. What is essential is that we desire a monotone relationship, either ascending or descending, between the experimental measurements and distances in the configuration. We shall refer only to dissimilarities and similarities, but we explicitly include in these terms all the varied kinds of measurement indicated above. We also note that similarities can always be replaced by dissimilarities (for example, replace s, by k -s,). Since our procedure uses only the rank},

abstract = {Simulated vegetation data were used to assess the relative robustness of ordination techniques to variations in the model of community variation in relation to environment. The methods compared were local non-metric multidimensional scaling (LNMDS), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), Gaussian ordination (GO), principal components analysis (PCA) and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA). Both LNMDS and PCoA were applied to a matrix of Bray-Curtis coefficients. The results clearly demonstrated the ineffective-ness of the linear techniques (PCA, PCoA), due to curvilinear distortion. Gaussian ordination proved very sensitive to noise and was not robust to marked departures from a symmetric, unimodal response model. The currently popular method of DCA displayed a lack of robustness to variations in the response model and the sampling pattern. Furthermore, DCA ordinations of two-dimensional models often exhibited marked distortions, even when response surfaces were unimodal and symmetric. LNMDS is recommended as a robust technique for indirect gradient analysis, which deserves more widespread use by community ecol-ogists.},

The concept oflCA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal.

abstract = {We provide a framework for structural multiscale geometric orga-nization of graphs and subsets of ‫ޒ‬ n . We use diffusion semigroups to generate multiscale geometries in order to organize and repre-sent complex structures. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions or scaling functions of Markov matrices, which describe local transitions, lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newto-nian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration. We provide a unified view of ideas from data analysis, machine learning, and numerical analysis. T he geometric organization of graphs and data sets in ‫ޒ‬ n is a central problem in statistical data analysis. In the continuous Euclidean setting, tools from harmonic analysis, such as Fourier decompositions, wavelets, and spectral analysis of pseudo-differential operators, have proven highly successful in many areas such as compression, denoising, and density estimation (1, 2). In this paper, we extend multiscale harmonic analysis to discrete graphs and subsets of ‫ޒ‬ n . We use diffusion semigroups to define and generate multiscale geometries of complex structures. This frame-work generalizes some aspects of the Newtonian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration, the global functions being characterized by differential equations. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions of Markov matrices (describing local transitions, or affinities in the system) lead to macroscopic representations at different scales. In particular, the top eigenfunctions permit a low-dimensional geometric embedding of the set into ‫ޒ‬ k , with k Ͻ Ͻ n, so that the ordinary Euclidean distance in the embedding space measures intrinsic diffusion metrics on the data. Many of these ideas appear in a variety of contexts of data analysis, such as spectral graph theory, manifold learning, nonlinear principal components, and kernel methods. We augment these approaches by showing that the diffusion distance is a key intrinsic geometric quantity linking spectral theory of the Markov process, Laplace operators, or kernels, to the corresponding geometry and density of the data. This opens the door to the application of methods from numerical analysis and signal processing to the analysis of functions and transformations of the data.},

A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression val-ues. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical cluster-ing and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analy-ses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KN-Nimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1–20{\%} missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.

abstract = {This paper reviews methods for handling missing data in a research study. Many researchers use ad hoc methods such as complete case analysis, available case analysis (pairwise deletion), or single-value imputation. Though these methods are easily implemented, they require assump-tions about the data that rarely hold in practice. Model-based methods such as maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm and multiple imputation hold more promise for dealing with dif{\textregistered}culties caused by missing data. While model-based methods require specialized computer programs and assumptions about the nature of the missing data, these methods are appropriate for a wider range of situations than the more commonly used ad hoc methods. The paper provides an illustration of the methods using data from an intervention study designed to increase students' ability to control their asthma symptoms. All researchers have faced the problem of missing quantitative data at some point in their work. Research informants may refuse or forget to answer a survey question, {\textregistered}les are lost, or data are not recorded properly. Given the expense of collecting data, we cannot afford to start over or to wait until we have developed foolproof methods of gathering information, an unattainable goal. We {\textregistered}nd ourselves left with the decision of how to analyze data when we do not have complete information from all informants. We are not alone in this problem; the United States Census Bureau has been involved in a debate with the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court over the handling of the under-count in the 2000 U.S. Census. Given that most researchers do not have the resources of the U.S. Census Bureau, what are the options available for analyzing data with missing information?},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have long relied on proposed statistical significance thresholds to be able to differentiate true positives from false positives. Although the genome-wide significance P-value threshold of 5 × 10 {\`{A}}8 has become a standard for common-variant GWAS, it has not been updated to cope with the lower allele frequency spectrum used in many recent array-based GWAS studies and sequencing studies. Using a whole-genome-and -exome-sequencing data set of 2875 individuals of European ancestry from the Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes (GoT2D) project and a whole-exome-sequencing data set of 13 000 individuals from five ancestries from the GoT2D and T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) projects, we describe guidelines for genome-and exome-wide association P-value thresholds needed to correct for multiple testing, explaining the impact of linkage disequilibrium thresholds for distinguishing independent variants, minor allele frequency and ancestry characteristics. We emphasize the advantage of studying recent genetic isolate populations when performing rare and low-frequency genetic association analyses, as the multiple testing burden is diminished due to higher genetic homogeneity. INTRODUCTION In genetic association analyses of complex traits, determining the correct P-value threshold for statistical significance is critical to control the number of false-positive associations. Although the genome-wide significance (WGS) P-value threshold of 5 × 10 − 8 has become a standard for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 1,2 it has not been updated to account for the lower allele frequency spectrum used in many recent array-based GWAS studies 3 and sequencing studies. Different statistical procedures accounting for multiple testing have been used in the genome-wide setting, including the naive Bonferroni correction, 4 which can be overly conservative due to the assumption that every genetic variant tested is independent of the rest; false discovery rate procedures, 5 permutation based-approaches 2 and Bayesian approaches. 6 Here, we set out to perform an updated evaluation of the significance threshold for genome-wide genetic association studies designed to discover loci associated with complex traits using a multiple testing approach to control the number of false-positive associations. Guidelines developed in this paper can be useful for researchers using human sequence data (for either direct association testing or as an imputation panel) to evaluate variants in the lower frequency spectrum of their samples. In 2005 the International HapMap Consortium 1 used permutation testing of genotypes in 10 densely genotyped Encyclopedia of DNA Elements genomic regions to estimate the number of common independent variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 5{\%}) to be 150 per 500 kilobase pairs (kb) in European population. Extrapolating to all the genome ({\~{}}3.3 Gb) suggested a significance threshold of 5 × 10 − 8 . Since then, this WGS threshold became a standard for reporting genome-wide association significance hits at MAF ≥ 5{\%} for European ancestry populations. 2,3 Moreover, the HapMap variation catalog 1,7 established most of the variation that one could test for association and set a P-value threshold for WGS that was invariant to a study's sample size at MAF ≥ 5{\%}. More recently, whole-exome-and -genome-sequencing projects greatly expanded the number of genetic variants that one could use in association studies. In the 1000 Genomes sequencing project, 8 it was observed that {\~{}} 50{\%} of observed genetic variants were novel, even in the well-characterized Encyclopedia of DNA Elements regions. Sequencing studies lead to an increased number of low-frequency (0.5{\%}oMAFo5{\%}) and rare (MAFo0.5{\%}) variants, arguing for a more stringent statistical threshold for association testing in studies utilizing sequence data.},

Applications are envisaged in which each variable represents a qualitatively different measure of response to treatment. The null hypothesis of no treatment difference is tested with power directed towards alternatives in which at least one treatment is uniformly better than the others. In all simulations the nonparametric procedure provided relatively good power and accurate control over the size of the test, and is recommended for general use.

abstract = {Large scale genomic studies with multiple phenotypic or genotypic measures may require the identification of complex multivariate relationships. In multivariate analysis a common way to inspect the relationship between two sets of variables based on their correlation is canonical correlation analysis, which determines linear combinations of all variables of each type with maximal correlation between the two linear combinations. However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number of variables under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets of variables, i.e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations of variables of each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) which examines the relationships between two types of variables and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets of variables of each type by maximizing the correlation between the subsets of variables of different types while performing variable selection. We also present an extension of SCCA -adaptive SCCA. We evaluate their properties using simulated data and illustrate practical use by applying both methods to the study of natural variation in human gene expression.},

The purpose of analyzing multivariate phenotypes usually includes discovery of novel genetic variants of pleiotropy effects, that is, affecting multiple phenotypes, and the ultimate goal of uncovering the underlying genetic mechanism. In recent years, there have been new method development and application of existing statistical methods to such phenotypes. In this paper, we provide a review of the available methods for analyzing association between a single marker and a multivariate phenotype consisting of the same type of components (e.g., all continuous or all categorical) or different types of components (e.g., some are continuous and others are categorical). We also reviewed causal inference methods designed to test whether the detected association with the multivariate phenotype is truly pleiotropy or the genetic marker exerts its effects on some phenotypes through affecting the others.},

abstract = {A multiple-trait QTL mapping method using least squares is described. It is presented as an extension of a single-trait method for use with three-generation, outbred pedigrees. The multiple-trait framework allows formal testing of whether the same QTL affects more than one trait (i.e., a pleiotropic QTL) or whether more than one linked QTL are segregating. Several approaches to the testing procedure are presented and their suitability discussed. The performance of the method is investigated by simulation.

abstract = {An approach to increase the efficiency of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) was proposed earlier by the authors on the basis of bivariate analysis of correlated traits. The power of QTL detection using the log-likelihood ratio (LOD scores) grows proportionally to the broad sense heritability. We found that this relationship holds also for correlated traits, so that an increased bivariate heritability implicates a higher LOD score, higher detection power, and better mapping resolution. However, the increased number of parameters to be estimated complicates the application of this approach when a large number of traits are considered simultaneously. Here we present a multivariate generalization of our previous two-trait QTL analysis. The proposed multivariate analogue of QTL contribution to the broad-sense heritability based on interval-specific calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the residual covariance matrix allows prediction of the expected QTL detection power and mapping resolution for any subset of the initial multivariate trait complex. Permutation technique allows chromosome-wise testing of significance for the whole trait complex and the significance of the contribution of individual traits owing to: (a) their correlation with other traits, (b) dependence on the chromosome in question, and (c) both a and b. An example of application of the proposed method on a real data set of 11 traits from an experiment performed on an F 2 /F 3 mapping population of tetraploid wheat (Triticum durum ϫ T. dicoccoides) is provided. T HE detection power and mapping resolution of Soller 1994), replicated progeny testing (Soller and Beckmann 1990), and sequential experimentation marker analysis of quantitative traits are the major factors affecting practical applications of quantitative (Motro and Soller 1993). For example, in composite mapping the increase in mapping resolution derives trait loci (QTL) mapping. These characteristics strongly depend on the effect of the QTL in question relative from a reduction of the residual variation by taking into account the effects of cosegregating QTL. to the phenotypic variance of the trait in the mapping population.

abstract = {Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extremely important method in exploratory and confirmatory data analysis. Unfortunately, in complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model. 1. Is ANOVA obsolete? What is the analysis of variance? Econometricians see it as an uninteresting special case of linear regression. Bayesians see it as an inflexible classical method. Theoretical statisticians have supplied many mathematical definitions [see, e.g., Speed (1987)]. Instructors see it as one of the hardest topics in classical statistics to teach, especially in its more elaborate forms such as split-plot analysis. We believe, however, that the ideas of ANOVA are useful in many applications of statistics. For the purpose of this paper, we identify ANOVA with the structuring of parameters into batches—that is, with variance components models. There are more general mathematical formulations of the analysis of variance, but this is the aspect that we believe is most relevant in applied statistics, especially for regression modeling.},

This paper first reviews some of the existing quality measures that are based on distance ranking and K-ary neighborhoods. Next, the definition of the co-ranking matrix provides a tool for comparing the ranks in the initial data set and some low-dimensional embedding. Rank errors and concepts such as neighborhood intrusions and extrusions can then be associated with different blocks of the co-ranking matrix. Several quality criteria can be cast within this unifying framework; they are shown to involve one or several of these characteristic blocks. Following this line, simple criteria are proposed, which quantify two aspects of the embedding quality, namely its overall quality and its tendency to favor intrusions or extrusions. They are applied to several recent dimensionality reduction methods in two experiments, with both artificial and real data.},

Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions.

abstract = {Ribonucleotide reductase activity is essential for progression through the cell cycle, catalyzing the rate-limiting step for the production of deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. The enzymatic activity of the enzyme fluctuates in the cell cycle with an activity maximum in S phase. We have identified and characterized two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, RNR1 and RNR3. They share approximately 80{\%} amino acid identity with each other and 60{\%} with the mammalian homolog, M1. Genetic disruption reveals that the RNR1 gene is essential for mitotic viability, whereas the RNR3 gene is not essential. A high-copy-number clone of RNR3 is able to suppress the lethality of rnr1 mutations. Analysis of mRNA levels in cell-cycle-synchronized cultures reveals that the RNR1 mRNA is tightly cell-cycle regulated, fluctuating 15- to 30-fold, and is coordinately regulated with the POL1 mRNA, being expressed in the late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Progression from the alpha-factor-induced G1 block to induction of RNR1 mRNA is blocked by cycloheximide, further defining the requirement for protein synthesis in the G1- to S-phase transition. Both RNR1 and RNR3 transcripts are inducible by treatments that damage DNA, such as 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and methylmethanesulfonate, or block DNA replication, such as hydroxyurea. RNR1 is inducible 3- to 5-fold, and RNR3 is inducible greater than 100-fold. When MATa cells are arrested in G1 by alpha-factor, RNR1 and RNR3 mRNA is still inducible by DNA damage, indicating that the observed induction can occur outside of S phase. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity by hydroxyurea treatment results in arrest of the cell cycle in S phase as large budded, uninucleate cells. This specific cell-cycle arrest is independent of the RAD9 gene, defining a separate pathway for the coordination of DNA synthesis and cell-cycle progression.},

abstract = {The GCD2 protein is a translational repressor of GCN4, the transcriptional activator of multiple amino acid biosynthetic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We present evidence that GCD2 has a general function in the initiation of protein synthesis in addition to its gene-specific role in translational control of GCN4 expression. Two temperature-sensitive lethal gcd2 mutations result in sensitivity to inhibitors of protein synthesis at the permissive temperature, and the gcd2-503 mutation leads to reduced incorporation of labeled leucine into total protein following a shift to the restrictive temperature of 36 degrees C. The gcd2-503 mutation also results in polysome runoff, accumulation of inactive 80S ribosomal couples, and accumulation of at least one of the subunits of the general translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) in 43S-48S particles following a shift to the restrictive temperature. The gcd2-502 mutation causes accumulation of 40S subunits in polysomes, known as halfmers, that are indicative of reduced 40S-60S subunit joining at the initiation codon. These phenotypes suggest that GCD2 functions in the translation initiation pathway at a step following the binding of eIF-2.GTP.Met-tRNA(iMet) to 40S ribosomal subunits. consistent with this hypothesis, we found that inhibiting 40S-60S subunit joining by deleting one copy (RPL16B) of the duplicated gene encoding the 60S ribosomal protein L16 qualitatively mimics the phenotype of gcd2 mutations in causing derepression of GCN4 expression under nonstarvation conditions. However, deletion of RPL16B also prevents efficient derepression of GCN4 under starvation conditions, indicating that lowering the concentration of 60S subunits and reducing GCD2 function affect translation initiation at GCN4 in different ways. This distinction is in accord with a recently proposed model for GCN4 translational control in which ribosomal reinitiation at short upstream open reading frames in the leader of GCN4 mRNA is suppressed under amino acid starvation conditions to allow for increased reinitiation at the GCN4 start codon.},

We also present a complementary approach, 'population parameters previously determined' (P3D), that eliminates the need to re-compute variance components. We applied these two methods both independently and combined in selected genetic association datasets from human, dog and maize. The joint implementation of these two methods markedly reduced computing time and either maintained or improved statistical power. We used simulations to demonstrate the usefulness in controlling for substructure in genetic association datasets for a range of species and genetic architectures.

We identified 30 distinct loci associated with lipoprotein concentrations (each with P {\textless} 5 x 10(-8)), including 11 loci that reached genome-wide significance for the first time. The 11 newly defined loci include common variants associated with LDL cholesterol near ABCG8, MAFB, HNF1A and TIMD4; with HDL cholesterol near ANGPTL4, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3, HNF4A, LCAT, PLTP and TTC39B; and with triglycerides near AMAC1L2, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3 and PLTP. The proportion of individuals exceeding clinical cut points for high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides varied according to an allelic dosage score (P {\textless} 10(-15) for each trend).

Variance component approaches, such as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), can correct for a wide range of sample structures by explicitly accounting for pairwise relatedness between individuals, using high-density markers to model the phenotype distribution; but such approaches are computationally impractical. We report here a variance component approach implemented in publicly available software, EMMA eXpedited (EMMAX), that reduces the computational time for analyzing large GWAS data sets from years to hours. We apply this method to two human GWAS data sets, performing association analysis for ten quantitative traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort and seven common diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We find that EMMAX outperforms both principal component analysis and genomic control in correcting for sample structure.},

abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human association studies such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

@article{Zhao2007,
abstract = {A potentially serious disadvantage of association mapping is the fact that marker-trait associations may arise from confounding population structure as well as from linkage to causative polymorphisms. Using genome-wide marker data, we have previously demonstrated that the problem can be severe in a global sample of 95 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, and that established methods for controlling for population structure are generally insufficient. Here, we use the same sample together with a number of flowering-related phenotypes and data-perturbation simulations to evaluate a wider range of methods for controlling for population structure. We find that, in terms of reducing the false-positive rate while maintaining statistical power, a recently introduced mixed-model approach that takes genome-wide differences in relatedness into account via estimated pairwise kinship coefficients generally performs best. By combining the association results with results from linkage mapping in F2 crosses, we identify one previously known true positive and several promising new associations, but also demonstrate the existence of both false positives and false negatives. Our results illustrate the potential of genome-wide association scans as a tool for dissecting the genetics of natural variation, while at the same time highlighting the pitfalls. The importance of study design is clear; our study is severely under-powered both in terms of sample size and marker density. Our results also provide a striking demonstration of confounding by population structure. While statistical methods can be used to ameliorate this problem, they cannot always be effective and are certainly not a substitute for independent evidence, such as that obtained via crosses or transgenic experiments. Ultimately, association mapping is a powerful tool for identifying a list of candidates that is short enough to permit further genetic study.},

abstract = {The use, in association studies, of the forthcoming dense genomewide collection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been heralded as a potential breakthrough in the study of the genetic basis of common complex disorders. A serious problem with association mapping is that population structure can lead to spurious associations between a candidate marker and a phenotype. One common solution has been to abandon case-control studies in favor of family-based tests of association, such as the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), but this comes at a considerable cost in the need to collect DNA from close relatives of affected individuals. In this article we describe a novel, statistically valid, method for case-control association studies in structured populations. Our method uses a set of unlinked genetic markers to infer details of population structure, and to estimate the ancestry of sampled individuals, before using this information to test for associations within subpopulations. It provides power comparable with the TDT in many settings and may substantially outperform it if there are conflicting associations in different subpopulations.},

abstract = {Many studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to continuous variation in heritable traits of interest. However, general principles regarding the distribution of QTL numbers, effect sizes, and combined effects of multiple QTLs remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterize complex genetics underlying inheritance of thousands of transcript levels in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most detected QTLs have weak effects, with a median variance explained of 27{\%} for highly heritable transcripts. Despite the high statistical power of the study, no QTLs were detected for 40{\%} of highly heritable transcripts, indicating extensive genetic complexity. Modeling of QTL detection showed that only 3{\%} of highly heritable transcripts are consistent with single-locus inheritance, 17-18{\%} are consistent with control by one or two loci, and half require more than five loci under additive models. Strikingly, analysis of parent and progeny trait distributions showed that a majority of transcripts exhibit transgressive segregation. Sixteen percent of highly heritable transcripts exhibit evidence of interacting loci. Our results will aid design of future QTL mapping studies and may shed light on the evolution of quantitative traits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We aimed to test the diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in distinguishing pathological left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) from lesser degrees of trabecular layering seen in healthy volunteers and, in those with cardiomyopathies and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, potential differential diagnoses. We hypothesized that pathological trabeculation could be distinguished by determining the ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium (NC/C ratio). BACKGROUND Left ventricular non-compaction is characterized by a non-compacted myocardial layer in the left ventricle. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images this layer with unprecedented quality, particularly in the ventricular apex, where echocardiography has inherent difficulties. METHODS We analyzed magnetic resonance cine images, using the 17-segment model in 45 healthy volunteers, 25 athletes, 39 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 14 with dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 with hypertensive heart disease, and 30 with aortic stenosis, as well as images from 7 patients previously diagnosed with LVNC whose diagnoses were supported by additional features. RESULTS Areas of non-compaction were common and occurred more frequently in all groups studied in apical and lateral, rather than in basal or septal, segments. A NC/C ratio of {\textgreater}2.3 in diastole distinguished pathological non-compaction, with values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictions of 86{\%}, 99{\%}, 75{\%}, and 99{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Left ventricular non-compaction is diagnosed accurately with CMR using the NC/C ratio in diastole.},

abstract = {It is apparent that despite lack of family history, patients with the morphological characteristics of left ventricular non-compaction develop arrhythmias, thrombo-embolism and left ventricular dysfunction. Forty two patients, aged 48.7 ± 2.3 yrs (mean ± SEM) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for the quantification of left ventricular volumes and extent of non-compacted (NC) myocardium. The latter was quantified using planimetry on the two-chamber long axis LV view (NC area). The patients included those referred specifically for CMR to investigate suspected cardiomyopathy, and as such is represents a selected group of patients. At presentation, 50{\%} had dyspnoea, 19{\%} chest pain, 14{\%} palpitations and 5{\%} stroke. Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 7{\%} and brachial artery embolism in 2{\%}. The ECG was abnormal in 81{\%} and atrial fibrillation occurred in 29{\%}. Transthoracic echocardiograms showed features of NC in only 10{\%}. On CMR, patients who presented with dyspnoea had greater left ventricular volumes (both p {\textless} 0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p {\textless} 0.0001) than age-matched, healthy controls. In patients without dyspnoea (n = 21), NC area correlated positively with end-diastolic volume (r = 0.52, p = 0.0184) and end-systolic volume (r = 0.56, p = 0.0095), and negatively with EF (r = -0.72, p = 0.0001). Left ventricular non-compaction is associated with dysrrhythmias, thromboembolic events, chest pain and LV dysfunction. The inverse correlation between NC area and EF suggests that NC contributes to left ventricular dysfunction.},

Clearly, the widely used standard covariance and correlation estimators are ill-suited for this purpose. As statistically efficient and computationally fast alternative we propose a novel shrinkage covariance estimator that exploits the Ledoit-Wolf (2003) lemma for analytic calculation of the optimal shrinkage intensity. Subsequently, we apply this improved covariance estimator (which has guaranteed minimum mean squared error, is well-conditioned, and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks. We show that it performs very favorably compared to competing approaches both in simulations as well as in application to real expression data.},

abstract = {A major task in understanding biological processes is to elucidate the relationships between genes involved in the underlying biological pathways. Microarray data from an increasing number of biologically interrelated experiments now allows for more complete portrayals of functional gene relationships in the pathways. In current studies of gene relationships, the presence of expression dependencies attributable to the biologically interrelated experiments, however, has been widely ignored. When unaccounted for, these (experiment) dependencies can result in inaccurate inferences of functional gene relationships, and hence incorrect biological conclusions. This article contributes a framework consisting of a model and an estimation procedure to infer gene relationships when there are two-way dependencies in the gene expression matrix (the gene-wise and experiment-wise dependencies). The main aspect of the framework is the use of a Kronecker product covariance matrix to model the gene-experiment interactions...},

For this purpose a regularization approach is adopted, introducing a smoothing penalty coherent with the geodesic distance over the manifold. The model introduced can be applied to any manifold topology, can naturally handle missing data and functional samples evaluated in different grids of points. We approach the discretization task by means of finite element analysis and propose an efficient iterative algorithm for its resolution. We compare the performances of the proposed algorithm with other approaches classically adopted in literature. We finally apply the proposed method to resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project, where the method shows substantial differential variations between brain regions that were not apparent with other approaches.},

Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Multiple explanations for this 'missing heritability' have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from near zero to approximately 50 per cent. Detected two-locus interactions explain only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications for future studies of complex and quantitative traits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subtle abnormalities of the myocardium may be present in mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+LVH-) but are difficult to quantify. Fractal analysis has been used to define trabeculae in left ventricular noncompaction and to identify normal racial variations. We hypothesized that trabeculae measured by fractal analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images are abnormal in G+LVH- patients, providing a preclinical marker of disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 40 G+LVH- patients (33±15 years, 38{\%} men), 67 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (53±15 years, 76{\%} men; 31 with a pathogenic mutation [G+LVH+]), and 69 matched healthy volunteers (44±15 years, 57{\%} men). Trabeculae were quantified by fractal analysis of cine slices to calculate the fractal dimension, a unitless index of endocardial complexity calculated from endocardial contours after segmentation. In G+LVH- patients, apical left ventricular trabeculation was increased compared with controls (maximal apical fractal dimension, 1.249±0.07 versus 1.199±0.05; P=0.001). In G+LVH+ and G-LVH+ cohorts, maximal apical fractal dimension was greater than in controls (P{\textless}0.0001) irrespective of gene status (G+LVH+: 1.370±0.08; G-LVH+: 1.380±0.09). Compared with controls, G+LVH- patients also had a higher frequency of clefts (28{\%} versus 8{\%}; P=0.02), longer anterior mitral valve leaflets (23.5±3.0 versus 19.7±3.1 mm; P{\textless}0.0001), greater septal systolic wall thickness (12.6±3.2 versus 11.2±2.1 mm; P=0.03), higher ejection fraction (71±4{\%} versus 69±4{\%}; P=0.03), and smaller end-systolic volumes (38±9 versus 43±12 mL; P=0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: Increased myocardial trabecular complexity is one of several preclinical abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sarcomere gene mutation carriers without LVH.},

abstract = {AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure with a high familial recurrence risk. So far, the genetics of DCM remains largely unresolved. We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci contributing to sporadic DCM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and seventy-nine DCM patients and 1108 controls contributed to the discovery phase. Pools of DNA stratified on disease status, population, age, and gender were constituted and used for testing association of DCM with 517 382 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Three DCM-associated SNPs were confirmed by individual genotyping (P {\textless} 5.0 10(-7)), and two of them, rs10927875 and rs2234962, were replicated in independent samples (1165 DCM patients and 1302 controls), with P-values of 0.002 and 0.009, respectively. rs10927875 maps to a region on chromosome 1p36.13 which encompasses several genes among which HSPB7 has been formerly suggested to be implicated in DCM. The second identified locus involves rs2234962, a non-synonymous SNP (c.T757C, p. C151R) located within the sequence of BAG3 on chromosome 10q26. To assess whether coding mutations of BAG3 might cause monogenic forms of the disease, we sequenced BAG3 exons in 168 independent index cases diagnosed with familial DCM and identified four truncating and two missense mutations. Each mutation was heterozygous, present in all genotyped relatives affected by the disease and absent in a control group of 347 healthy individuals, strongly suggesting that these mutations are causing the disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This GWAS identified two loci involved in sporadic DCM, one of them probably implicates BAG3. Our results show that rare mutations in BAG3 contribute to monogenic forms of the disease, while common variant(s) in the same gene are implicated in sporadic DCM.},

abstract = {Despite considerable progress in preventive and therapeutic strategies, myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. A total of 55 susceptibility genes have been identified mostly in European genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, large-scale GWAS from other population could possibly find additional susceptibility loci. To identify as many MI susceptibility loci as possible, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis in Japanese population. To identify MI susceptibility loci in Japanese, we conducted a GWAS using 1666 cases and 3198 controls using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and HumanHap550v3 Genotyping BeadChip. We performed replication studies using a total of 11,412 cases and 28,397 controls in the Japanese population. Our study identified two novel susceptibility loci for MI: PLCL2 on chromosome 3p24.3 (rs4618210:A{\textgreater}G, P = 2.60 x 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 0.91) and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs3803915:A{\textgreater}C, P = 3.84 x 10(-9), OR = 0.89). Besides, a total of 14 previously reported MI susceptibility loci were replicated in our study. In particular, we validated a strong association on chromosome 12q24 (rs3782886:A{\textgreater}G: P = 1.14 x 10(-14), OR = 1.46). Following pathway analysis using 265 genes related to MI or coronary artery disease, we found that these loci might be involved in the pathogenesis of MI via the promotion of atherosclerosis. In the present large-scale genomic analysis, we identified PLCL2 and AP3D1-DOT1L-SF3A2 as new susceptibility loci for MI in the Japanese population. Our findings will add novel findings for MI susceptibility loci.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent genome-wide association studies in which selected community populations are used have identified genomic signals in SCN10A influencing PR duration. The extent to which this can be demonstrated in cohorts derived from electronic medical records is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a genome-wide association study on 2334 European American patients with normal ECGs without evidence of prior heart disease from the Vanderbilt DNA databank, BioVU, which accrues subjects from routine patient care. Subjects were identified by combinations of natural language processing, laboratory queries, and billing code queries of deidentified medical record data. Subjects were 58{\%} female, of mean (± SD) age 54 ± 15 years, and had mean PR intervals of 158 ± 18 ms. Genotyping was performed with the use of the Illumina Human660W-Quad platform. Our results identify 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6800541, rs6795970, rs6798015, rs7430477) linked to SCN10A associated with PR interval (P=5.73 × 10(-7) to 1.78 × 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS This genome-wide association study confirms a gene heretofore not implicated in cardiac pathophysiology as a modulator of PR interval in humans. This study is one of the first replication genome-wide association studies performed with the use of an electronic medical records-derived cohort, supporting their further use for genotype-phenotype analyses.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by chaotic electrical activity of the atria. It affects one in ten individuals over the age of 80 years, causes significant morbidity and is an independent predictor of mortality. Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in potassium-channel genes have been associated with familial AF but account for only a small fraction of all cases of AF. We have performed a genome-wide association scan, followed by replication studies in three populations of European descent and a Chinese population from Hong Kong and find a strong association between two sequence variants on chromosome 4q25 and AF. Here we show that about 35{\%} of individuals of European descent have at least one of the variants and that the risk of AF increases by 1.72 and 1.39 per copy. The association with the stronger variant is replicated in the Chinese population, where it is carried by 75{\%} of individuals and the risk of AF is increased by 1.42 per copy. A stronger association was observed in individuals with typical atrial flutter. Both variants are adjacent to PITX2, which is known to have a critical function in left-right asymmetry of the heart.},

Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) {\textgreater} 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 {\textless} MAF {\textless} 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.},

We now report genome-wide association studies of pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). In discovery (N = 74,064) and follow-up studies (N = 48,607), we identified at genome-wide significance (P = 2.7 × 10 -8 to P = 2.3 × 10 -13) four new PP loci (at 4q12 near CHIC2, 7q22.3 near PIK3CG, 8q24.12 in NOV and 11q24.3 near ADAMTS8), two new MAP loci (3p21.31 in MAP4 and 10q25.3 near ADRB1) and one locus associated with both of these traits (2q24.3 near FIGN) that has also recently been associated with SBP in east Asians. For three of the new PP loci, the estimated effect for SBP was opposite of that for DBP, in contrast to the majority of common SBP- and DBP-associated variants, which show concordant effects on both traits. These findings suggest new genetic pathways underlying blood pressure variation, some of which may differentially influence SBP and DBP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52{\%} women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51{\%} women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or = 0.10, call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Associations at p {\textless} 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {\textless} 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 [times] 10-12) and Parkinson disease (log OR = -0.15, P = 1.6 [times] 10-7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a myocardial disorder characterized by excessive left ventricular (LV) trabeculae. Current methods for quantification of LV trabeculae have limitations. The aim of this study is to describe a novel technique for quantifying LV trabeculation using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and fractal geometry. Observing that trabeculae appear complex and irregular, we hypothesize that measuring the fractal dimension (FD) of the endocardial border provides a quantitative parameter that can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal trabecular patterns. METHODS: Fractal analysis is a method of quantifying complex geometric patterns in biological structures. The resulting FD is a unitless measure index of how completely the object fills space. FD increases with increased structural complexity. LV FD was measured using a box-counting method on CMR short-axis cine stacks. Three groups were studied: LVNC (defined by Jenni criteria), n=30(age 41±13; men, 16); healthy whites, n=75(age, 46±16; men, 36); healthy blacks, n=30(age, 40±11; men, 15). RESULTS: In healthy volunteers FD varied in a characteristic pattern from base to apex along the LV. This pattern was altered in LVNC where apical FD were abnormally elevated. In healthy volunteers, blacks had higher FD than whites in the apical third of the LV (maximal apical FD: 1.253±0.005 vs. 1.235±0.004, p{\textless}0.01) (mean±s.e.m.). Comparing LVNC with healthy volunteers, maximal apical FD was higher in LVNC (1.392±0.010, p{\textless}0.00001). The fractal method was more accurate and reproducible (ICC, 0.97 and 0.96 for intra and inter-observer readings) than two other CMR criteria for LVNC (Petersen and Jacquier). CONCLUSIONS: FD is higher in LVNC patients compared to healthy volunteers and is higher in healthy blacks than in whites. Fractal analysis provides a quantitative measure of trabeculation and has high reproducibility and accuracy for LVNC diagnosis when compared to current CMR criteria.},

abstract = {Purpose To quantitatively determine the population variation and relationship of left ventricular (LV) trabeculation to LV function, structure, and clinical variables. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant multicenter study was approved by institutional review boards of participating centers. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) data were evaluated to quantify LV trabeculation as a fractal dimension (FD). Entire cohort participants free of cardiac disease, hypertrophy, hypertension, and diabetes were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into three reference groups (BMI {\textless}25 kg/m(2); BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) to {\textless}30 kg/m(2); and BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) to explore maximal apical FD (FDMaxApical). Multivariable linear regression models determined the relationship between FD and other parameters. Results Included were 2547 participants (mean age, 68.7 years ± 9.1 [standard deviation]; 1211 men). FDMaxApical are in arbitrary units. FDMaxApical reference ranges for BMI 30 kg/m(2) or greater (n = 163), 25 kg/m(2) or greater to less than 30 kg/m(2) (n = 206), and less than 25 kg/m(2) (n = 235) were 1.203 ± 0.06 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.194, 1.212), 1.194 ± 0.06 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.186, 1.202), and 1.169 ± 0.05 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.162, 1.176), respectively. In the entire cohort, adjusted for anthropometrics, trabeculation was higher in African American participants (standardized $\beta$ [s$\beta$] = 0.09; P ≤ .001) and Hispanic participants (s$\beta$ = 0.05; P = .013) compared with white participants and was also higher in African American participants compared with Chinese American participants (s$\beta$ = 0.08; P = .01), and this persisted after adjustment for hypertension and LV size. Hypertension (s$\beta$ = 0.07; P {\textless} .001), LV mass (s$\beta$ = 0.22; P {\textless} .001), and wall thickness (s$\beta$ = 0.27; P {\textless} .001) were positively associated with FDMaxApical even after adjustment. In the group with BMIs less than 25 kg/m(2), Chinese American participants had less trabeculation than white participants (s$\beta$ = -0.15; P = .032). Conclusion Fractal analysis of cardiac MR imaging data measures endocardial complexity, which helps to differentiate normal from abnormal trabecular patterns in healthy versus diseased hearts. Trabeculation is influenced by race and/or ethnicity and, more importantly, by cardiac loading conditions and comorbidities. Clinicians who interpret cine MR imaging data should expect slightly less endocardial complexity in Chinese American patients and more in African American patients, Hispanic patients, hypertensive patients, and those with hypertrophy.

abstract = {Jarid2/Jumonji critically regulates developmental processes including cardiovascular development. Jarid2 knock-out mice exhibit cardiac defects including hypertrabeculation with noncompaction of the ventricular wall. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Jarid2-mediated cardiac development remain unknown. To determine the cardiac lineage-specific roles of Jarid2, we generated myocardial, epicardial, cardiac neural crest, or endothelial conditional Jarid2 knock-out mice using Cre-loxP technology. Only mice with an endothelial deletion of Jarid2 recapitulate phenotypic defects observed in whole body mutants including hypertrabeculation and noncompaction of the ventricle. To identify potential targets of Jarid2, combinatorial approaches using microarray and candidate gene analyses were employed on Jarid2 knock-out embryonic hearts. Whole body or endothelial deletion of Jarid2 leads to increased endocardial Notch1 expression in the developing ventricle, resulting in increased Notch1-dependent signaling to the adjacent myocardium. Using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Jarid2 was found to occupy a specific region on the endogenous Notch1 locus. We propose that failure to properly regulate Notch signaling in Jarid2 mutants likely leads to the defects in the developing ventricular chamber. The identification of Jarid2 as a potential regulator of Notch1 signaling has broad implications for many cellular processes including development, stem cell maintenance, and tumor formation.},

abstract = {In this study we challenge the generally accepted view that cardiac chambers form from an array of segmental primordia arranged along the anteroposterior axis of the linear and looping heart tube. We traced the spatial pattern of expression of genes encoding atrial natriuretic factor, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, Chisel, Irx5, Irx4, myosin light chain 2v, and beta-myosin heavy chain and related these to morphogenesis. Based on the patterns we propose a two-step model for chamber formation in the embryonic heart. First, a linear heart forms, which is composed of "primary" myocardium that nonetheless shows polarity in phenotype and gene expression along its anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. Second, specialized ventricular chamber myocardium is specified at the ventral surface of the linear heart tube, while distinct left and right atrial myocardium forms more caudally on laterodorsal surfaces. The process of looping aligns these primordial chambers such that they face the outer curvature. Myocardium of the inner curvature, as well as that of inflow tract, atrioventricular canal, and outflow tract, retains the molecular signature originally found in linear heart tube myocardium. Evidence for distinct transcriptional programs which govern compartmentalization in the forming heart is seen in the patterns of expression of Hand1 for the dorsoventral axis, Irx4 and Tbx5 for the anteroposterior axis, and Irx5 for the distinction between primary and chamber myocardium.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular development has become a crucial element of transgene technology in that many transgenic and knockout mice unexpectedly present with a cardiac phenotype, which often turns out to be embryolethal. This demonstrates that formation of the heart and the connecting vessels is essential for the functioning vertebrate organism. The embryonic mesoderm is the source of both the cardiogenic plate, giving rise to the future myocardium as well as the endocardium that will line the system on the inner side. Genetic cascades are unravelled that direct dextral looping and subsequent secondary looping and wedging of the outflow tract of the primitive heart tube. This tube consists of a number of transitional zones and intervening primitive cardiac chambers. After septation and valve formation, the mature two atria and two ventricles still contain elements of the primitive chambers as well as transitional zones. An essential additional element is the contribution of extracardiac cell populations like neural crest cells and epicardium-derived cells. Whereas the neural crest cell is of specific importance for outflow tract septation and formation of the pharyngeal arch arteries, the epicardium-derived cells are essential for proper maturation of the myocardium and coronary vascular formation. Inductive signals, sometimes linked to apoptosis, of the extracardiac cells are thought to be instructive for differentiation of the conduction system. In summary, cardiovascular development is a complex interplay of many cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Study of both (transgenic) animal models and human pathology is unravelling the mechanisms underlying congenital cardiac anomalies.},

abstract = {Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.},

@article{Guan2008,
abstract = {Imputation-based association methods provide a powerful framework for testing untyped variants for association with phenotypes and for combining results from multiple studies that use different genotyping platforms. Here, we consider several issues that arise when applying these methods in practice, including: (i) factors affecting imputation accuracy, including choice of reference panel; (ii) the effects of imputation accuracy on power to detect associations; (iii) the relative merits of Bayesian and frequentist approaches to testing imputed genotypes for association with phenotype; and (iv) how to quickly and accurately compute Bayes factors for testing imputed SNPs. We find that imputation-based methods can be robust to imputation accuracy and can improve power to detect associations, even when average imputation accuracy is poor. We explain how ranking SNPs for association by a standard likelihood ratio test gives the same results as a Bayesian procedure that uses an unnatural prior assumption--specifically, that difficult-to-impute SNPs tend to have larger effects--and assess the power gained from using a Bayesian approach that does not make this assumption. Within the Bayesian framework, we find that good approximations to a full analysis can be achieved by simply replacing unknown genotypes with a point estimate--their posterior mean. This approximation considerably reduces computational expense compared with published sampling-based approaches, and the methods we present are practical on a genome-wide scale with very modest computational resources (e.g., a single desktop computer). The approximation also facilitates combining information across studies, using only summary data for each SNP. Methods discussed here are implemented in the software package BIMBAM, which is available from http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html.},

abstract = {Both polygenicity (many small genetic effects) and confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification, can yield an inflated distribution of test statistics in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, current methods cannot distinguish between inflation from a true polygenic signal and bias. We have developed an approach, LD Score regression, that quantifies the contribution of each by examining the relationship between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD). The LD Score regression intercept can be used to estimate a more powerful and accurate correction factor than genomic control. We find strong evidence that polygenicity accounts for the majority of the inflation in test statistics in many GWAS of large sample size.},

@article{Devlin2004,
abstract = {In the study of complex disease, separating causal from confounded factors is a challenge for genetic epidemiologists. One tool useful for separating these factors is Genomic Control (GC). In this communication we clarify how and when to use GC. We also describe a refined approach to GC, which should be used when GC is applied to extreme settings. Population-based studies, such as case-control studies, are common designs used to determine the genetic and environmental bases of disease. To avoid false positive associations, design and analysis of population-based studies should account for population stratification, which can inflate association test statistics. One analytic method used to control the false positive rate is GC. In our original paper1, we investigated two scenarios with two corresponding analytic methods. GC is the version similar to the typical approach to hypothesis testing, and GCB is the version that uses Bayesian inference. GC is suitable when a modest number of candidate genes are assessed and L supplementary loci are included for control. The supplementary loci, called null loci, are used to correct any inflation, , in association test statistic(s) by estimating from the null test statistics. GC produces average rejection rates close to the targeted 0.05 significance level2, 3, 4. We also considered population-based studies when large numbers of markers are tested1. GCB is designed for this scenario. Rather than preselecting null loci, GCB delineates loci associated with disease as 'outliers' relative to most of the loci tested. In our original papers1, 2, we argued that a population-based study should attempt to remove the effect of stratification by experimental design and analysis, such as by matching cases and controls for ethnicity and environmental covariates. GC then adjusts for the residual effects of stratification. Careful study design and implementation pay off in statistical power5, 6; even small stratification can have considerable consequences for large samples1, 2, 3, 4, 5.},

abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21{\%} more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37{\%} increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.},

abstract = {We present in this paper models and statistical methods for performing multiple trait analysis on mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) based on the composite interval mapping method. By taking into account the correlated structure of multiple traits, this joint analysis has several advantages, compared with separate analyses, for mapping QTL, including the expected improvement on the statistical power of the test for QTL and on the precision of parameter estimation. Also this joint analysis provides formal procedures to test a number of biologically interesting hypotheses concerning the nature of genetic correlations between different traits. Among the testing procedures considered are those for joint mapping, pleiotropy, QTL by environment interaction, and pleiotropy vs. close linkage. The test of pleiotropy (one pleiotropic QTL at a genome position) vs. close linkage (multiple nearby nonpleiotropic QTL) can have important implications for our understanding of the nature of genetic correlations between different traits in certain regions of a genome and also for practical applications in animal and plant breeding because one of the major goals in breeding is to break unfavorable linkage. Results of extensive simulation studies are presented to illustrate various properties of the analyses.},

Here, I review several methods that have been developed to perform multiple trait analysis.

abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the new types of information. The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

@article{Stephens2013,
abstract = {We consider the problem of assessing associations between multiple related outcome variables, and a single explanatory variable of interest. This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations - that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5-10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a standard approach for studying the genetics of natural variation. A major concern in GWAS is the need to account for the complicated dependence structure of the data, both between loci as well as between individuals. Mixed models have emerged as a general and flexible approach for correcting for population structure in GWAS. Here, we extend this linear mixed-model approach to carry out GWAS of correlated phenotypes, deriving a fully parameterized multi-trait mixed model (MTMM) that considers both the within-trait and between-trait variance components simultaneously for multiple traits. We apply this to data from a human cohort for correlated blood lipid traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 and show greatly increased power to detect pleiotropic loci that affect more than one blood lipid trait. We also apply this approach to an Arabidopsis thaliana data set for flowering measurements in two different locations, identifying loci whose effect depends on the environment.},

@article{Bolormaa2014,
abstract = {Polymorphisms that affect complex traits or quantitative trait loci (QTL) often affect multiple traits. We describe two novel methods (1) for finding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with one or more traits using a multi-trait, meta-analysis, and (2) for distinguishing between a single pleiotropic QTL and multiple linked QTL. The meta-analysis uses the effect of each SNP on each of n traits, estimated in single trait genome wide association studies (GWAS). These effects are expressed as a vector of signed t-values (t) and the error covariance matrix of these t values is approximated by the correlation matrix of t-values among the traits calculated across the SNP (V). Consequently, t'V-1t is approximately distributed as a chi-squared with n degrees of freedom. An attractive feature of the meta-analysis is that it uses estimated effects of SNPs from single trait GWAS, so it can be applied to published data where individual records are not available. We demonstrate that the multi-trait method can be used to increase the power (numbers of SNPs validated in an independent population) of GWAS in a beef cattle data set including 10,191 animals genotyped for 729,068 SNPs with 32 traits recorded, including growth and reproduction traits. We can distinguish between a single pleiotropic QTL and multiple linked QTL because multiple SNPs tagging the same QTL show the same pattern of effects across traits. We confirm this finding by demonstrating that when one SNP is included in the statistical model the other SNPs have a non-significant effect. In the beef cattle data set, cluster analysis yielded four groups of QTL with similar patterns of effects across traits within a group. A linear index was used to validate SNPs having effects on multiple traits and to identify additional SNPs belonging to these four groups.},

@article{Bottolo2013,
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) yielded significant advances in defining the genetic architecture of complex traits and disease. Still, a major hurdle of GWAS is narrowing down multiple genetic associations to a few causal variants for functional studies. This becomes critical in multi-phenotype GWAS where detection and interpretability of complex SNP(s)-trait(s) associations are complicated by complex Linkage Disequilibrium patterns between SNPs and correlation between traits. Here we propose a computationally efficient algorithm (GUESS) to explore complex genetic-association models and maximize genetic variant detection. We integrated our algorithm with a new Bayesian strategy for multi-phenotype analysis to identify the specific contribution of each SNP to different trait combinations and study genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS). Despite the relatively small size of GHS (n = 3,175), when compared with the largest published meta-GWAS (n {\textgreater} 100,000), GUESS recovered most of the major associations and was better at refining multi-trait associations than alternative methods. Amongst the new findings provided by GUESS, we revealed a strong association of SORT1 with TG-APOB and LIPC with TG-HDL phenotypic groups, which were overlooked in the larger meta-GWAS and not revealed by competing approaches, associations that we replicated in two independent cohorts. Moreover, we demonstrated the increased power of GUESS over alternative multi-phenotype approaches, both Bayesian and non-Bayesian, in a simulation study that mimics real-case scenarios. We showed that our parallel implementation based on Graphics Processing Units outperforms alternative multi-phenotype methods. Beyond multivariate modelling of multi-phenotypes, our Bayesian model employs a flexible hierarchical prior structure for genetic effects that adapts to any correlation structure of the predictors and increases the power to identify associated variants. This provides a powerful tool for the analysis of diverse genomic features, for instance including gene expression and exome sequencing data, where complex dependencies are present in the predictor space.},

abstract = {Many human traits are highly correlated. This correlation can be leveraged to improve the power of genetic association tests to identify markers associated with one or more of the traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool that has been widely used for the multivariate analysis of correlated variables. PCA is usually applied as a dimension reduction method: the few top principal components (PCs) explaining most of total trait variance are tested for association with a predictor of interest, and the remaining components are not analyzed. In this study we review the theoretical basis of PCA and describe the behavior of PCA when testing for association between a SNP and correlated traits. We then use simulation to compare the power of various PCA-based strategies when analyzing up to 100 correlated traits. We show that contrary to widespread practice, testing only the top PCs often has low power, whereas combining signal across all PCs can have greater power. This power gain is primarily due to increased power to detect genetic variants with opposite effects on positively correlated traits and variants that are exclusively associated with a single trait. Relative to other methods, the combined-PC approach has close to optimal power in all scenarios considered while offering more flexibility and more robustness to potential confounders. Finally, we apply the proposed PCA strategy to the genome-wide association study of five correlated coagulation traits where we identify two candidate SNPs that were not found by the standard approach.},

abstract = {Association between disease and genetic polymorphisms often contributes critical information in our search for the genetic components of common diseases. Devlin and Roeder [1999: Biometrics 55:997-1004] introduced genomic control, a statistical method that overcomes a drawback to the use of population-based samples for tests of association, namely spurious associations induced by population structure. In essence, genomic control (GC) uses markers throughout the genome to adjust for any inflation in test statistics due to substructure. To date, genomic control (GC) has been developed for binary traits and bi- or multiallelic markers. Tests of association using GC have been limited to single genes. In this report, we generalize GC to quantitative traits (QT) and multilocus models. Using statistical analysis and simulations, we show that GC controls spurious associations in reasonable settings of population substructure for QT models, including gene-gene interaction. Through simulations, we explore GC power for both random and selected samples, assuming the QT locus tested is causal and its specific heritability is 2.5-5{\%}. We find that GC, combined with either random or selected samples, has good power in this setting, and that more complex models induce smaller GC corrections. The latter suggests greater power can be achieved by specifying more complex genetic models, but this observation only follows when such models are largely correct and specified a priori.},

Usually, the scaled median or mean test statistic for association calculated from multiple single-nucleotide-polymorphisms across the genome is used to assess such effects, and 'genomic control' can be applied subsequently to adjust test statistics at individual loci by a genomic inflation factor. Published GWAS have clearly shown that there are many loci underlying genetic variation for a wide range of complex diseases and traits, implying that a substantial proportion of the genome should show inflation of the test statistic. Here, we show by theory, simulation and analysis of data that in the absence of population structure and other technical artefacts, but in the presence of polygenic inheritance, substantial genomic inflation is expected. Its magnitude depends on sample size, heritability, linkage disequilibrium structure and the number of causal variants. Our predictions are consistent with empirical observations on height in independent samples of {\~{}}4000 and {\~{}}133,000 individuals.},

The adjusted methods are evaluated using a sample of 726 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and 707 group-matched controls, genotyped at 84,975 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in 2,000 randomly chosen genes. The tests for genetic association with AD at loci within each gene are combined. The number of loci tested per gene varies from 2 to 994. The adjusted combined p-values agree well with the significance of the combined p-values determined empirically by random permutation of the data (Sid{\'{a}}k correction: r=0.990; Fisher's method: r=0.994). This indicates that the combined p-values can be used to assess the relative strength of evidence for association of these genes with AD. The adjustment proposed here is a refinement of that of Nyholt ([2004] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 74:765-769), giving improved agreement with the results of random permutation. The improvement obtained is similar to that given by the refinement proposed by Li and Ji ([2005] Heredity 95:221-227). It is concluded that the concept of an effective number of tests is a valid approximation that allows p-values to be combined in a highly informative way.},

abstract = {Applications of linear mixed models (LMMs) to problems in genomics include phenotype prediction, correction for confounding in genome-wide association studies, estimation of narrow sense heritability, and testing sets of variants (e.g., rare variants) for association. In each of these applications, the LMM uses a genetic similarity matrix, which encodes the pairwise similarity between every two individuals in a cohort. Although ideally these similarities would be estimated using strictly variants relevant to the given phenotype, the identity of such variants is typically unknown. Consequently, relevant variants are excluded and irrelevant variants are included, both having deleterious effects. For each application of the LMM, we review known effects and describe new effects showing how variable selection can be used to mitigate them.},

abstract = {A recently identified variant within the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is carried by 46{\%} of Western Europeans and is associated with an approximately 1.2 kg higher weight, on average, in adults and an approximately 1 cm greater waist circumference. With {\textgreater}1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers had an average brain volume difference of approximately 8{\%} in the frontal lobes and 12{\%} in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or the volume of white matter hyperintensities; which were not detectably higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health of the elderly.},

We investigated structural and functional effects of the APOE polymorphism in 18 young healthy APOE epsilon4-carriers and 18 matched noncarriers (age range: 20-35 years). Brain activity was studied both at rest and during an encoding memory paradigm using blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Resting fMRI revealed increased "default mode network" (involving retrosplenial, medial temporal, and medial-prefrontal cortical areas) coactivation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. The encoding task produced greater hippocampal activation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. Neither result could be explained by differences in memory performance, brain morphology, or resting cerebral blood flow. The APOE epsilon4 allele modulates brain function decades before any clinical or neurophysiological expression of neurodegenerative processes.},

abstract = {Pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes varies both within and between human populations. Identifying the genes and alleles underlying this variation has been the goal of many candidate gene and several genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most GWAS for pigmentary traits to date have been based on subjective phenotypes using categorical scales. But skin, hair, and eye pigmentation vary continuously. Here, we seek to characterize quantitative variation in these traits objectively and accurately and to determine their genetic basis. Objective and quantitative measures of skin, hair, and eye color were made using reflectance or digital spectroscopy in Europeans from Ireland, Poland, Italy, and Portugal. A GWAS was conducted for the three quantitative pigmentation phenotypes in 176 women across 313,763 SNP loci, and replication of the most significant associations was attempted in a sample of 294 European men and women from the same countries. We find that the pigmentation phenotypes are highly stratified along axes of European genetic differentiation. The country of sampling explains approximately 35{\%} of the variation in skin pigmentation, 31{\%} of the variation in hair pigmentation, and 40{\%} of the variation in eye pigmentation. All three quantitative phenotypes are correlated with each other. In our two-stage association study, we reproduce the association of rs1667394 at the OCA2/HERC2 locus with eye color but we do not identify new genetic determinants of skin and hair pigmentation supporting the lack of major genes affecting skin and hair color variation within Europe and suggesting that not only careful phenotyping but also larger cohorts are required to understand the genetic architecture of these complex quantitative traits. Interestingly, we also see that in each of these four populations, men are more lightly pigmented in the unexposed skin of the inner arm than women, a fact that is underappreciated and may vary across the world.},

abstract = {The structure of the human brain is highly heritable, and is thought to be influenced by many common genetic variants, many of which are currently unknown. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age+/-s.d.: 75.52+/-6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover genetic influences on brain structure.},

However, current methods implement only a very specific range of tasks to optimize the necessary computations. Here, we present a multi-trait modeling framework that is versatile and fast: LIMIX enables to flexibly adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study designs. To highlight the novel modeling aspects of LIMIX we performed three vastly different genetic studies: joint GWAS of correlated blood lipid phenotypes, joint analysis of the expression levels of the multiple transcript-isoforms of a gene, and pathway-based modeling of molecular traits across environments. In these applications we show that LIMIX increases GWAS power and phenotype prediction accuracy, in particular when integrating stepwise multi-locus regression into multi-trait models, and when analyzing large numbers of traits. An open source implementation of LIMIX is freely available at: https://github.com/PMBio/limix.},

Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24{\%}) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which produce huge volumes of data, are now being carried out by many groups around the world, creating a need for user-friendly tools for data quality control (QC) and analysis. One critical aspect of GWAS QC is evaluating genotype cluster plots to verify sensible genotype calling in putatively associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Evoker is a tool for visualizing genotype cluster plots, and provides a solution to the computational and storage problems related to working with such large datasets.

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {Raw data sets taken with various capturing devices are usually multidimensional and need to be$\backslash$rpreprocessed before applying subsequent operations, such as clustering, classification, outlier$\backslash$rdetection, noise filtering etc. One of the steps of data preprocessing is dimensionality reduction. It has$\backslash$rbeen developed with an aim to reduce or eliminate information bearing secondary importance, and$\backslash$rretain or highlight meaningful information while reducing the dimensionality of data.$\backslash$rSince the nature of real-world data is often nonlinear, linear dimensionality reduction techniques,$\backslash$rsuch as principal component analysis (PCA), fail to preserve a structure and relationships in a$\backslash$rhighdimensional space when data are mapped into a low-dimensional space. This means that$\backslash$rnonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are in demand in this case. Among them is a method$\backslash$rcalled locally linear embedding (LLE), which is the focus of this thesis. Its main attractive$\backslash$rcharacteristics are few free parameters to be set and a non-iterative solution avoiding the convergence$\backslash$rto a local minimum. In this thesis, several extensions to the conventional LLE are proposed, which$\backslash$raid us to overcome some limitations of the algorithm. The study presents a comparison between LLE$\backslash$rand three nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (isometric feature mapping (Isomap), selforganizing$\backslash$rmap (SOM) and fast manifold learning based on Riemannian normal coordinates (SLogMap)$\backslash$rapplied to manifold learning. This comparison is of interest, since all of the listed methods$\backslash$rreduce high-dimensional data in different ways, and it is worth knowing for which case a particular$\backslash$rmethod outperforms others.$\backslash$rA number of applications of dimensionality reduction techniques exist in data mining. One of$\backslash$rthem is visualization of high-dimensional data sets. The main goal of data visualization is to find a$\backslash$rone, two or three-dimensional descriptive data projection, which captures and highlights important$\backslash$rknowledge about data while eliminating the information loss. This process helps people to explore$\backslash$rand understand the data structure that facilitates the choice of a proper method for the data analysis,$\backslash$re.g., selecting simple or complex classifier etc. The application of LLE for visualization is described$\backslash$rin this research.$\backslash$rThe benefits of dimensionality reduction are commonly used in obtaining compact data$\backslash$rrepresentation before applying a classifier. In this case, the main goal is to obtain a low-dimensional$\backslash$rdata representation, which possesses good class separability. For this purpose, a supervised variant of$\backslash$rLLE (SLLE) is proposed in this thesis.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the cardiovascular system has evolved through the years by extensive studies emphasizing the identification of the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in its normal function and disease pathogenesis. Major discoveries have been made along the way. However, the majority of this work has focused on specific genes or pathways rather than integrative approaches. In cardiomyopathies alone, over 30 different loci have shown mutations with varying inheritance patterns, yet mostly coding for structural proteins. The emergence of microarrays in the early 1990s paved the way to a new era of cardiovascular research. Microarrays dramatically accelerated the rhythm of discoveries by giving us the ability to simultaneously study thousands of genes in a single experiment. In the field of cardiovascular research, microarrays are having a significant contribution, with the majority of work focusing on end-stage cardiomyopathies that lead to heart failure. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, known pathways are seen under new light, disease subgroups begin to emerge, and the effects of various drugs are molecularly dissected. This cross-study data comparison concludes that consistent energy metabolism gene expression changes occur across dilated, hypertrophic, and ischemic cardiomyopathies, while Ca2+ homeostasis changes are prominent in the first two cardiomyopathies, and structural gene expression changes accompany mostly the dilated form. Gene expression changes are further correlated to disease genetics. The future of microarrays in the cardiomyopathy field is discussed with an emphasis on optimum experimental design and on applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug discovery.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

abstract = {The switch to a modern lifestyle in recent decades has coincided with a rapid increase in prevalence of obesity and other diseases. These shifts in prevalence could be explained by the release of genetic susceptibility for disease in the form of gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Yet, the detection of interaction effects requires large sample sizes, little replication has been reported, and a few studies have demonstrated environmental effects only after summing the risk of GWAS alleles into genetic risk scores (GRSxE). We performed extensive simulations of a quantitative trait controlled by 2500 causal variants to inspect the feasibility to detect gene-by-environment interactions in the context of GWAS. The simulated individuals were assigned either to an ancestral or a modern setting that alters the phenotype by increasing the effect size by 1.05-2-fold at a varying fraction of perturbed SNPs (from 1 to 20{\%}). We report two main results. First, for a wide range of realistic scenarios, highly significant GRSxE is detected despite the absence of individual genotype GxE evidence at the contributing loci. Second, an increase in phenotypic variance after environmental perturbation reduces the power to discover susceptibility variants by GWAS in mixed cohorts with individuals from both ancestral and modern environments. We conclude that a pervasive presence of gene-by-environment effects can remain hidden even though it contributes to the genetic architecture of complex traits.},

abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P {\textless} 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10{\%} of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16{\%} of phenotypic variation (approximately 20{\%} of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability. PEER extends previous related surrogate variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) measurements, exercise responses to standardized treadmill test (ETT) and brachial artery (BA) vascular function are heritable traits that are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the community-based Framingham Heart Study. METHODS: We estimated multivariable-adjusted residuals for quantitative echocardiography, ETT and BA function traits. Echocardiography residuals were averaged across 4 examinations and included LV mass, diastolic and systolic dimensions, wall thickness, fractional shortening, left atrial and aortic root size. ETT measures (single exam) included systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses during exercise stage 2, and at 3 minutes post-exercise. BA measures (single exam) included vessel diameter, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and baseline and hyperemic flow responses. Generalized estimating equations (GEE), family-based association tests (FBAT) and variance-components linkage were used to relate multivariable-adjusted trait residuals to 70,987 SNPs (Human 100K GeneChip, Affymetrix) restricted to autosomal SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or =0.10, genotype call rate {\textgreater} or =0.80, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p {\textgreater} or = 0.001. RESULTS: We summarize results from 17 traits in up to 1238 related middle-aged to elderly men and women. Results of all association and linkage analyses are web-posted at http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. We confirmed modest-to-strong heritabilities (estimates 0.30-0.52) for several Echo, ETT and BA function traits. Overall, p {\textless} 10(-5) in either GEE or FBAT models were observed for 21 SNPs (nine for echocardiography, eleven for ETT and one for BA function). The top SNPs associated were (GEE results): LV diastolic dimension, rs1379659 (SLIT2, p = 1.17*10(-7)); LV systolic dimension, rs10504543 (KCNB2, p = 5.18*10(-6)); LV mass, rs10498091 (p = 5.68*10(-6)); Left atrial size, rs1935881 (FAM5C, p = 6.56*10(-6)); exercise heart rate, rs6847149 (NOLA1, p = 2.74*10(-6)); exercise systolic blood pressure, rs2553268 (WRN, p = 6.3*10(-6)); BA baseline flow, rs3814219 (OBFC1, 9.48*10(-7)), and FMD, rs4148686 (CFTR, p = 1.13*10(-5)). Several SNPs are reasonable biological candidates, with some being related to multiple traits suggesting pleiotropy. The peak LOD score was for LV mass (4.38; chromosome 5); the 1.5 LOD support interval included NRG2. CONCLUSION: In hypothesis-generating GWAS of echocardiography, ETT and BA vascular function in a moderate-sized community-based sample, we identified several SNPs that are candidates for replication attempts and we provide a web-based GWAS resource for the research community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and validation study for left ventricular (LV) mass in the Family Blood Pressure Program-HyperGEN population. LV mass is a sensitive predictor of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in all genders, races, and ages. Polymorphisms of candidate genes in diverse pathways have been associated with LV mass. However, subsequent studies have often failed to replicate these associations. Genome-wide association studies have unprecedented power to identify potential genes with modest effects on left LV mass. We describe here a GWAS for LV mass in Caucasians using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100 k Set. Cases (N = 101) and controls (N = 101) were selected from extreme tails of the LV mass index distribution from 906 individuals in the HyperGEN study. Eleven of 12 promising (Q {\textless} 0.8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the genome-wide study were successfully genotyped using quantitative real time PCR in a validation study. RESULTS: Despite the relatively small sample, we identified 12 promising SNPs in the GWAS. Eleven SNPs were successfully genotyped in the validation study of 704 Caucasians and 1467 African Americans; 5 SNPs on chromosomes 5, 12, and 20 were significantly (P {\textless} or = 0.05) associated with LV mass after correction for multiple testing. One SNP (rst is intragenic within KCNB1, which is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, a previously reported candidate gene for LV hypertrophy within this population. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest KCNB1 may be involved in the development of LV hypertrophy in humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using data from 4 community-based cohorts of African Americans, we tested the association between genome-wide markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and cardiac phenotypes in the Candidate-gene Association Resource study.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 6765 African Americans, we related age, sex, height, and weight-adjusted residuals for 9 cardiac phenotypes (assessed by echocardiogram or magnetic resonance imaging) to 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped using Genome-wide Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affy6.0) and the remainder imputed. Within the cohort, genome-wide association analysis was conducted, followed by meta-analysis across cohorts using inverse variance weights (genome-wide significance threshold=4.0 ×10(-7)). Supplementary pathway analysis was performed. We attempted replication in 3 smaller cohorts of African ancestry and tested lookups in 1 consortium of European ancestry (EchoGEN). Across the 9 phenotypes, variants in 4 genetic loci reached genome-wide significance: rs4552931 in UBE2V2 (P=1.43×10(-7)) for left ventricular mass, rs7213314 in WIPI1 (P=1.68×10(-7)) for left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, rs1571099 in PPAPDC1A (P=2.57×10(-8)) for interventricular septal wall thickness, and rs9530176 in KLF5 (P=4.02×10(-7)) for ejection fraction. Associated variants were enriched in 3 signaling pathways involved in cardiac remodeling. None of the 4 loci replicated in cohorts of African ancestry was confirmed in lookups in EchoGEN.

CONCLUSIONS: In the largest genome-wide association study of cardiac structure and function to date in African Americans, we identified 4 genetic loci related to left ventricular mass, interventricular septal wall thickness, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, and ejection fraction, which reached genome-wide significance. Replication results suggest that these loci may be unique to individuals of African ancestry. Additional large-scale studies are warranted for these complex phenotypes.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a common, inherited cardiac muscle disease, is primarily caused by mutations in sarcomeric protein-encoding genes and is characterized by overgrowth of ventricular muscle that is highly variable in extent and location. This variability has been partially attributed to locus and allelic heterogeneity of the disease-causing gene, but other factors, including unknown genetic factors, also modulate the extent of hypertrophy that develops in response to the defective sarcomeric functioning. Components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are plausible candidate hypertrophy modifiers because of their role in controlling blood pressure and biological effects on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.},

abstract = {In this review, we discuss current evidence linking environmental pollutants to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Extensive evidence indicates that environmental factors contribute to CVD risk, incidence, and severity. Migrant studies show that changes in the environment could substantially alter CVD risk in a genetically stable population. Additionally, CVD risk is affected by changes in nutritional and lifestyle choices. Recent studies in the field of environmental cardiology suggest that environmental toxins also influence CVD. Exposure to tobacco smoke is paradigmatic of such environmental risk and is strongly and positively associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In animal models of exposure, tobacco smoke induces endothelial dysfunction and prothrombotic responses and exacerbates atherogenesis and myocardial ischemic injury. Similar mechanism may be engaged by other pollutants or food constituents. Several large population-based studies indicate that exposure to fine or ultrafine particulate air pollution increases CVD morbidity and mortality, and the plausibility of this association is supported by data from animal studies. Exposure to other chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and metals has also been reported to elevate CVD risk by affecting atherogenesis, thrombosis, or blood pressure regulation. Maternal exposure to drugs, toxins, and infection has been linked with cardiac birth defects and premature CVD in later life. Collectively, the data support the notion that chronic environmental stress is an important determinant of CVD risk. Further work is required to assess the magnitude of this risk fully and to delineate specific mechanisms by which environmental toxins affect CVD.},

abstract = {Background This review discusses the incidence and importance of congenital heart disease (CHD), the reasons that investigation of causative mechanisms for human CHD has been slow, and the limitations of the multifactorial theory for the etiology of CHD. Methods and Results The molecular defects underlying three vasculopathies--Marfan's syndrome (fibrillin), supravalvar aortic stenosis, and Williams' syndrome (elastin)--and hereditary telangiectasia are presented to emphasize the role of microfibrils and extracellular matrix in the pathophysiology of these vascular defects. Animal models of CHD, including situs inversus, canine conotruncal malformations, and chick neural crest ablation, are examined to emphasize how such studies relate to human CHD, especially by pointing to single-gene defects for conotruncal malformations, candidate loci for situs inversus, and phenotypic variability caused by neural crest lesions. The crucial role of cardiac transcription factors in heart morphogenesis is emphasized by review of gene knockout studies of these factors, which cause fetal death secondary to heart maldevelopment. Several lines of evidence demonstrating genetic etiologies of human CHD are also presented, including the mapping of familial atrial septal defects, to prove that one anatomic type of CHD may be due to single-gene defects at different loci. Review of atrioventricular canal, both secondary to trisomy 21 and as an autosomal-dominant familial defect, reiterates this conclusion. The evidence that monosomy on chromosome 22 causes multiple types of CHD, including aortic arch and conotruncal defects as part of the CATCH-22 syndrome, is presented, with results supporting the idea that deletions at this site alone may cause 5{\%} of surgically treated CHD. Conclusions We conclude that (1) human CHD is frequently due to single-gene defects and that even sporadic defects may arise from a single-gene abnormality; (2) a common genetic defect may cause several apparently different forms of CHD; (3) elucidation of the genetic basis of CHD provides clues to normal cardiovascular developmental biology; (4) the same cardiac malformation can be caused by mutant genes at different loci; and (5) interactions of clinical investigators (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons) with basic scientists should allow more rapid progress in defining the genetic basis of CHD.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) structure and function are heritable phenotypes of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify common genetic variants associated with cardiac structure and function by conducting a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 5 population-based cohort studies (stage 1) with replication (stage 2) in 2 other community-based samples. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Within each of 5 community-based cohorts comprising the EchoGen consortium (stage 1; n = 12 612 individuals of European ancestry; 55{\%} women, aged 26-95 years; examinations between 1978-2008), we estimated the association between approximately 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; imputed to the HapMap CEU panel) and echocardiographic traits. In stage 2, SNPs significantly associated with traits in stage 1 were tested for association in 2 other cohorts (n = 4094 people of European ancestry). Using a prespecified P value threshold of 5 x 10(-7) to indicate genome-wide significance, we performed an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of genome-wide association data from each cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic traits: LV mass, internal dimensions, wall thickness, systolic dysfunction, aortic root, and left atrial size. RESULTS: In stage 1, 16 genetic loci were associated with 5 echocardiographic traits: 1 each with LV internal dimensions and systolic dysfunction, 3 each with LV mass and wall thickness, and 8 with aortic root size. In stage 2, 5 loci replicated (6q22 locus associated with LV diastolic dimensions, explaining {\textless}1{\%} of trait variance; 5q23, 12p12, 12q14, and 17p13 associated with aortic root size, explaining 1{\%}-3{\%} of trait variance). CONCLUSIONS: We identified 5 genetic loci harboring common variants that were associated with variation in LV diastolic dimensions and aortic root size, but such findings explained a very small proportion of variance. Further studies are required to replicate these findings, identify the causal variants at or near these loci, characterize their functional significance, and determine whether they are related to overt cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Abstract Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The known determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy only partially explain its variability. The purpose of this study was to estimate heritability of left ventricular mass. The study sample included adults in the original Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study who were not receiving antihypertensive medications and who were free of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, valvular heart disease, and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass among first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and unrelated spouse pairs were calculated to determine the contribution of heredity to the variability in left ventricular mass. After adjustments for age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure, the intraclass correlations between first-degree relatives were .15 (parent-child, P{\textless}.001) to .16 (siblings, P{\textless}.001), between second-degree relatives the correlation was .06 (P=NS), and between spouses it was .05 (P=NS). The estimated heritability of adjusted left ventricular mass was between .24 and .32. The proportion of the variance in sex-specific left ventricular mass explained by age, height, weight, and systolic blood pressure was .26 in men and .34 in women. On the basis of intraclass correlations for left ventricular mass, incorporation of adjusted left ventricular mass of a parent or sibling would increase the explained variance by an additional .02 to .03. Heredity explains a small, but discernible proportion of the variance in left ventricular mass. Studies are currently under way to identify genetic markers that predict an individual's predisposition to left ventricular hypertrophy. This knowledge may lead to advances in the prevention of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but its underlying genetic factors remain largely elusive. To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and ∼ 2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P {\textless} 5 × 10⁻⁸), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.},

abstract = {Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized role in human disease. Here we report a public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale genotyping relies on the use of unsupervised automated calling algorithms to assign genotypes to hybridization data. A number of such calling algorithms have been recently established for the Affymetrix GeneChip genotyping technology. Here, we present a fast and accurate genotype calling algorithm for the Illumina BeadArray genotyping platforms. As the technology moves towards assaying millions of genetic polymorphisms simultaneously, there is a need for an integrated and easy-to-use software for calling genotypes. RESULTS: We have introduced a model-based genotype calling algorithm which does not rely on having prior training data or require computationally intensive procedures. The algorithm can assign genotypes to hybridization data from thousands of individuals simultaneously and pools information across multiple individuals to improve the calling. The method can accommodate variations in hybridization intensities which result in dramatic shifts of the position of the genotype clouds by identifying the optimal coordinates to initialize the algorithm. By incorporating the process of perturbation analysis, we can obtain a quality metric measuring the stability of the assigned genotype calls. We show that this quality metric can be used to identify SNPs with low call rates and accuracy. AVAILABILITY: The C++ executable for the algorithm described here is available by request from the authors.},

abstract = {Gene expression measurements are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as the state of the cell, experimental conditions and variants in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27{\%} of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs in human than previously shown.

@article{Kaski2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventionally, the first step in analyzing the large and high-dimensional data sets measured by microarrays is visual exploration. Dendrograms of hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps (SOMs), and multidimensional scaling have been used to visualize similarity relationships of data samples. We address two central properties of the methods: (i) Are the visualizations trustworthy, i.e., if two samples are visualized to be similar, are they really similar? (ii) The metric. The measure of similarity determines the result; we propose using a new learning metrics principle to derive a metric from interrelationships among data sets. RESULTS: The trustworthiness of hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, and the self-organizing map were compared in visualizing similarity relationships among gene expression profiles. The self-organizing map was the best except that hierarchical clustering was the most trustworthy for the most similar profiles. Trustworthiness can be further increased by treating separately those genes for which the visualization is least trustworthy. We then proceed to improve the metric. The distance measure between the expression profiles is adjusted to measure differences relevant to functional classes of the genes. The genes for which the new metric is the most different from the usual correlation metric are listed and visualized with one of the visualization methods, the self-organizing map, computed in the new metric. CONCLUSIONS: The conjecture from the methodological results is that the self-organizing map can be recommended to complement the usual hierarchical clustering for visualizing and exploring gene expression data. Discarding the least trustworthy samples and improving the metric still improves it.},

We used spatially dense quasi-landmarks to measure face shape in population samples with mixed West African and European ancestry from three locations (United States, Brazil, and Cape Verde). Using bootstrapped response-based imputation modeling (BRIM), we uncover the relationships between facial variation and the effects of sex, genomic ancestry, and a subset of craniofacial candidate genes. The facial effects of these variables are summarized as response-based imputed predictor (RIP) variables, which are validated using self-reported sex, genomic ancestry, and observer-based facial ratings (femininity and proportional ancestry) and judgments (sex and population group). By jointly modeling sex, genomic ancestry, and genotype, the independent effects of particular alleles on facial features can be uncovered. Results on a set of 20 genes showing significant effects on facial features provide support for this approach as a novel means to identify genes affecting normal-range facial features and for approximating the appearance of a face from genetic markers.},

abstract = {There is evidence across several species for genetic control of phenotypic variation of complex traits, such that the variance among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype), is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7{\%}, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA methylation. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants, including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes greater than 100,000.},

We present a method for estimating haplotypes, using genotype data from unrelated samples or small nuclear families, that leads to improved accuracy and speed compared to several widely used methods.

abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15{\%}-20{\%} lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are set to become the method of choice for uncovering the genetic basis of human diseases. A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

@article{Howie2011,
abstract = {Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population. These panel selection strategies become harder to apply and interpret as sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project produce larger and more diverse reference sets, which led us to develop an alternative framework. Our approach is built around a new approximation that uses local sequence similarity to choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype in each region of the genome. This approximation makes it computationally efficient to use all available reference haplotypes, which allows us to bypass the panel selection step and to improve accuracy at low-frequency variants by capturing unexpected allele sharing among populations. Using data from HapMap 3, we show that our framework produces accurate results in a wide range of human populations. We also use data from the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) to provide recommendations for imputation-based studies in Africa. We demonstrate that our approximation improves efficiency in large, sequence-based reference panels, and we discuss general computational strategies for modern reference datasets. Genome-wide association studies will soon be able to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and our work provides a practical way for investigators to use this rich information. New methodology from this study is implemented in the IMPUTE2 software package.},

@article{deMarvao2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac phenotypes, such as left ventricular (LV) mass, demonstrate high heritability although most genes associated with these complex traits remain unidentified. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have relied on conventional 2D cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) as the gold-standard for phenotyping. However this technique is insensitive to the regional variations in wall thickness which are often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and require large cohorts to reach significance. Here we test whether automated cardiac phenotyping using high spatial resolution CMR atlases can achieve improved precision for mapping wall thickness in healthy populations and whether smaller sample sizes are required compared to conventional methods. METHODS: LV short-axis cine images were acquired in 138 healthy volunteers using standard 2D imaging and 3D high spatial resolution CMR. A multi-atlas technique was used to segment and co-register each image. The agreement between methods for end-diastolic volume and mass was made using Bland-Altman analysis in 20 subjects. The 3D and 2D segmentations of the LV were compared to manual labeling by the proportion of concordant voxels (Dice coefficient) and the distances separating corresponding points. Parametric and nonparametric data were analysed with paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test respectively. Voxelwise power calculations used the interstudy variances of wall thickness. RESULTS: The 3D volumetric measurements showed no bias compared to 2D imaging. The segmented 3D images were more accurate than 2D images for defining the epicardium (Dice: 0.95 vs 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001; mean error 1.3 mm vs 2.2 mm, P {\textless} 0.001) and endocardium (Dice 0.95 vs 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001; mean error 1.1 mm vs 2.0 mm, P {\textless} 0.001). The 3D technique resulted in significant differences in wall thickness assessment at the base, septum and apex of the LV compared to 2D (P {\textless} 0.001). Fewer subjects were required for 3D imaging to detect a 1 mm difference in wall thickness (72 vs 56, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High spatial resolution CMR with automated phenotyping provides greater power for mapping wall thickness than conventional 2D imaging and enables a reduction in the sample size required for studies of environmental and genetic determinants of LV wall thickness.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

A well-known problem with such studies is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of association studies. The consequences of population structure on association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well, it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power. The results of our analysis can guide the design of large-scale association studies.},

abstract = {Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits. Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms.},
