\section{Image acquisition and phenotyping}
The cohort used for the genetic association study of left ventricular trabeculation consists of the Caucasian samples that passed the genotyping and imputation quality control described in \cref{subsection:genotypes}. Since there is no ground to suspect confounding of the phenotype processing based on the relatedness of samples as it was the case in the previous chapter (\cref{chapter:GWAS-3Dheart}), related samples were included in the cohort. For each of the \num{1207} samples, the level of trabeculation was measured at six to ten positions in the heart. Trabeculation was quantified via fractal analysis, a technique which allows to measure the complexity of patterns \citep{Eke2002}. Fractal analysis yields a unit-less measure, the fractal dimension (FD), which quantifies the complexity of the analysed structure. The higher the FD measure, the higher the complexity of the structure i.e. the more trabeculation is observed in the left ventricular wall. 

The pipeline for the automatic detection and quantification of trabeculation in the left ventricle was developed by Jiashen Cai and Pawel Tokarczuk. In the following paragraph, I briefly describe the image acquisition and phenotype extraction procedure. 

2D CMR imaging was conducted at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The fractal dimensions were derived from standard left ventricular short axis (LVSA) 2D CMR images in the plane from base to apex. Each section had a thickness of \num{8}~mm with a \num{2}~mm gap between sections. A more detailed description of the imaging parameters can be found in \citep{deMarvao2014}. Fractal analysis was automatised according to the protocol proposed by Captur and colleagues \citeyearpar{Captur2013}. First, the images (\cref{fig:scheme-fd}, \subfig{1}) were binarised into blood pool and myocardium (\cref{fig:scheme-fd}, \subfig{2}) and the endomyocardial border extracted via edge detection (\cref{fig:scheme-fd}, \subfig{3}). The FD was determined by placing grids with known spacing (scale) of increasing size (i.e. increasing number of edges) on the image and subsequent counting of the number of boxes with non-zero pixels, i.e. how many boxes contain at least one pixel of the border (\cref{fig:scheme-fd}, \subfig{4}). The slope of the linear regression of the ln-transformed scale versus the ln-transformed counts corresponds to the FD (\cref{fig:scheme-fd}, \subfig{5}) \citep{Captur2013}.

An example LVSA slice is depicted on the left, its location in the heart is indicated by the dashed line of the heart image on the right. 2. The image is binarised into blood pool (white) and other structures (black). 3. The border between the white and the black background is the endocardial wall, which can be extracted via edge detection. 4. A standard box-counting method is applied to the image of the extracted border, where grids of known spacing (scale) are placed on top of the image and boxes containing at least one pixel of endocardial borders are counted. 5. The slope of the regression of the ln-transformed scale versus the ln-transformed count is the FD. Adapted from \citep{Captur2013}.}

\section{The complexity of trabeculation shows a consistent base to apex pattern}
For \num{1192} out of the \num{1207} genotyped samples, FD measurements could successfully be computed at each slice. Their distribution from base to apex is depicted in \cref{fig:perslice-fd}. Both at the tip of the apex and the end of the basal zone, FD is generally lowest and increases towards the mid-section of the heart. Similar results have been observed by \citep{Kawel2012} and \citep{Captur2014}. The latter have shown that most variation between healthy and diseased individuals exists in FD measurements derived from the apical slices of the heart ( \cref{fig:perslice-fd}\subfig{A}) and used the maximal FD value observed in these slices as their final phenotype. I followed the strategy of dividing the measurements into apical and basal (\cref{fig:perslice-fd}\subfig{B}) and used the maximum FD observed in each group as final phenotypes. For individuals with uneven numbers of slices, the center slice was not considered for the computation of the maximum values.

I analysed the distribution of the \num{2} FD measurements  \(\text{FD}_\text{max}^\text{basal}\) and \(\text{FD}_\text{max}^\text{apical}\)in relation to biological and cardiac covariates. \Cref{fig:covariates-FD} shows the distribution of FD measurements and covariates, both as their respective univariate distribution (diagonal) and their dependent distributions. Both FD measurements show significant correlation with age, weight and left ventricular mass.   \(\text{FD}_\text{max}^\text{basal}\) is additionally significantly associated with height, while  \(\text{FD}_\text{max}^\text{apical}\) also shows significant correlation with sex (\cref{tab:covariates-FD}). The association of LVM and \(\text{FD}_\text{max}^\text{apical}\)  confirms the findings of the study by Captur and colleagues \citep{Captur2014}, who found increased FD measures for individuals with increased LVM. However, the causality of the relationship has not been determined yet. All significantly associated covariates except for LVM, as the causal relationship to FD measurements is unclear, were used as covariates in the genome-wide association study.
